Wo, I feel good
I knew that I would now
I feel good
I knew that I would now
So good, so good, I got you

Wo, I feel nice
Like sugar and spice
I feel nice
Like sugar and spice
So nice, so nice, I got you

When I hold you in my arms
I know that I can do no wrong
And when I hold you in my arms
My love won't do you no harm

And I feel nice
Like sugar and spice
I feel nice
Like sugar and spice
So nice, so nice, I got you

When I hold you in my arms
I know that I can't do no wrong
And when I hold you in my arms
My love can't do me no harm

And I feel nice
Like sugar and spice
I feel nice
Like sugar and spice
So nice, so nice, well I got you

Wo, I feel good
I knew that I wouldn't of
I feel good
I knew that I would
So good, so good, 'cause I got you
So good, so good, 'cause I got you
So good, so good, 'cause I got you
