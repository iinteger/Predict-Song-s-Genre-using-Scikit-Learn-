Ho ha ho ha
I hear somethin' sayin'
Ho ha ho ha
Ho ha ho ha

Well don't you know
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang
All day long they're sayin'
Ho ha ho ha
Ho ha ho ha

Well don't you know
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang

All day long they work so hard
Till the sun is going' down
Workin' on the highways and byways
And wearing, wearing a frown
You hear them moanin' their lives away
Then you hear somebody say

That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang

Can't hear them sayin'
Hmm, I'm goin' home one of these days
I'm goin' home
See my woman whom I love so dear
Meanwhile I have to work right here

Well don't you know
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang

All day long they're sayin'
Hmm, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my work is so hard
Give me water I'm thirsty
My, my work is so hard
My, my, my, my, my, my, my work is so hard
Oh ooo oh ooo, hmm
