Whenever I'm with him
Something inside starts to burning
And I'm filled with desire
Could it be the devil in me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?

It's like a heat wave
It's burning in my heart
I can't keep from burning
It's tearing me apart

Whenever he calls my name so softly and plain
Right then, right there, I feel that burning flame
Has high blood pressure got a hold on me?
Is this the way love's supposed to be?

It's like a heat wave
It's burning in my heart
I can't keep from burning
It's tearing me apart

Sometimes I stare in space
Tears all over my face
I can't explain it, don't understand it
I ain't never felt like this before

Now this funny feeling has me amazed
Don't know what to do, my head's in a haze
It's like a heat wave

Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Ha oh yeah

Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh yeah

I feel it burning right here in my heart
Don't you know it's like a heat wave?

Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh

Don't you know it's like a heat wave
Burning right here in my heart?
