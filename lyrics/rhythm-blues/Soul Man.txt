Coming to you on a dusty road
Good loving, I got a truck load
And when you get it, you got something
So don't worry, 'cause I'm coming

I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
And that ain't all

Got what I got the hard way
And I'll make better each and every day
So honey, don't you fret
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet

I'm a soul man, oh
I'm a soul man, play it
I'm a soul man, ha
I'm a soul man

I was brought up on a side street
Learned how to love before I could eat
I was educated from good stock
When I start loving, oh I can't stop

I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man, yeah
I'm a soul man

Grab the rope and I'll pull you in
Give you hope and be your only boyfriend
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)

I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
