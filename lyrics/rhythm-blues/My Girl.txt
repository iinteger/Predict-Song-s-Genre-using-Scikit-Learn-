I've got sunshine
On a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the moth of may
Well, I guess you say
What can make me feel this way
My girl, Talkin bout my girl
My girl
I've got so much honey
The bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees
Well, I guess you say
what can make me feel this way
My girl, Talkin bout my girl
My girl
I don't need no money
Fortune or fame
I got all the riches Baby
One man can claim
Well, I guess you say
What can make me feel this way
My girl, Talkin bout my girl
My girl
I got sunshine on a cloudy day
With my girl
I've even got the month of May
with my girl
Talkin bout, Talkin bout my girl
My girl
All I can talk about is my girl
My girl
