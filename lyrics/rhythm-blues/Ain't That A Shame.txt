You made me cry, when you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame
You're the one to blame

You broke my heart, when you said we're apart
Ain't that a shame
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame
You're the one to blame

Oh well, goodbye although I cry
Ain't that a shame
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame
You're the one to blame

You made me cry when you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame
You're the one to blame

Oh well, goodbye although I cry
Ain't that a shame
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame
You're the one to blame
