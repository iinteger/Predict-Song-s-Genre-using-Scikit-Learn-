Here's a chance to dance our way out of our constrictions
Gonna be freakin', up and down
Hang up alley way with the groove our
Only guide we shall all be moved

Ready or not here we come
Gettin' down on the one which we believe in
One nation under a groove, gettin' down just for the funk
(Can I get it on my good foot)
Gettin' down just for the funk of it

'Bout time I got down one time
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now

Feet don't fail me now

Feet don't fail me now
Do you promise to funk?
The whole funk, nothin' but the funk

Ready or not here we come
Gettin' down on the one which we believe in
Here's my chance to dance my way
Out of my constrictions

Our way out of our constrictions
Gonna be groovin' up and down
Hang up alley way

Feet don't fail me now
