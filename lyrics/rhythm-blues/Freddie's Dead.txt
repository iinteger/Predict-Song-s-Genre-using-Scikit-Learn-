(freddie's dead)
Hey, hey
Love, love
Yeah, yeah
Ah, ha
Freddies dead
That's what I said
Let the man rap a plan said he'd see him home
But his hope was a rope and he should've known
It's hard to understand
There was love in this man
I'm sure all would agree
That his misery was his woman and things
Now Freddie's dead
That's what I said

Everybody's misused him
Ripped him up and abused him
Another junkie plan
Pushin' dope for the man
A terrible blow but that's how it goes
A freddies on the corner now
If you wanna be a junkie, wow
Remember freddies dead

We're all built up with progress
But sometimes I must confess
We can deal with rockets and dreams
But reality
What does it mean?
Ain't nothing said
'Cause freddies dead

Hey, hey
Love, love
Hey, hey
Yeah, yeah
Ha, ha
Love, love
Yeah, yeah
Ha, ha
Yeah, yeah
Freddies dead

All I want is some peace of mind
With a little love I'm trying to find
This could be such a beautiful world
With a wonderful girl
Ooh, I need a woman child
Don't wanna be like freddie now
'Cause freddies dead
Hey, hey
Yeah, yeah
If you don't try
You're gonna die

Why can't we brothers?
Protect one another
No one's serious
And it makes me furious
Don't be misled
Just think of Fred
Everybody's misused him
Ripped him up and abused him
Another junkie plan
Pushin' dope for the man
A freddies on the corner now
If you wanna be a junkie, why
Remember freddies dead
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Freddies dead
Hey, hey
Ha, ha
Love, love
Ha, ha...
Ooh, hoo
Hey, hey
Love, love
Hey, hey
