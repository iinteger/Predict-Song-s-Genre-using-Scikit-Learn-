Come here sister Papa's in the swing
He ain't too hip about that new breed babe
He ain't no drag Papa's got a brand new bag

Come here Mama and dig this crazy scene
He's not too fancy but his line is pretty clean
He ain't no drag Papa's got a brand new bag

He's doing the Jerk, he's doing the Fly
Don't play him cheap 'cause you know he ain't shy
He's doing the Monkey, the Mashed Potatoes, Jump back Jack
See you later alligator

The thing's like the Boomerang

Doing the Monkey, the Mashed Potatoes, Jump back Jack
See you later alligator
