I bet you're wondering how I knew
'bout you're plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys you know I love you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday

Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine?
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah

Heard it through the grapevine?
Not much longer would you be mine, baby

I know that a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else

Instead, I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, well

Heard it through the grapevine?
Not much longer would you be mine, baby

People say believe half of what you see
Son, and none of what you hear
But I can't help bein' confused
If it's true, please tell me, dear?
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?

Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine?
Not much longer would you be mine
Baby, I heard it through the grapevine
Ooh I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

Heard it through the grapevine?
Not much longer would you be mine, baby

Honey, honey, I know
That you're letting me go
I said I heard through the grapevine
Ooh heard it through the grapevine
