Love me, love me
Love me, love me-lo
Love me, love me
Love me, love me-lo

Love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me-lo

I need it, I need it
When the moon is bright
I need it, I need it
When you hold me tight

I need it, I need it
In the middle of the night
I need your honey love

I want it, I want it
When the lights are low
I want it, I want it
Just before you go

I want it, I want it
Because I love you so
Have a little, a-mercy
And give some honey love

Now, throw your arms around me
Pretend that you're lovin' dove
Now, you squeeze, squeeze
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze
Squeeze, that's the honey love

I'm gonna get it, get it
In the morning sun
I'm gonna get it, get it
When the day is done

I'm gonna get it, get it
'Cause it's so much fun
I'm gonna get me some honey love

Yes, I love it, I love it
'Cause it feels so fine
I love it, I love it
Yes, it thrills my spine

I love it, I love it
'Cause you're mine all mine
I love your honey love

Love me, love me
Love me, love me-lo
Love me, love me
Love me, love me-lo

Love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me-lo

Let's you and me get cozy
Just like the fingers in a glove-a
Let's kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
That's the honey love

I need it, I need it
When the moon is bright
I need it, I need it
A-when you hold me tight

I need it, I need it
In the middle of the night
I need honey love

I need honey love
I need honey love
I need honey love
  (Get it, boy)
I need, your honey love
