It's your thing
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to

It's your thing
Do what you wanna do now
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to

If you want me to love you, maybe I will
I need you woman, it ain't no big deal
You need love now, just as bad as I do
Make's me no difference now, who you give your thing to

It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to

It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do now
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to

It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to

I'm not trying to run your life,
I know you wanna do what's right,
Ah, give your love girl, do whatever you choose,
How can you lose, with the stuff you use?

It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to

It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
Don't let me tell you
Who to sock it to

Let me hear you say it's my thing (It's your thing),
I do what I wanna do...
