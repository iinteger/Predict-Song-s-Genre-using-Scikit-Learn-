It's the Duke of Earl…
(Celebrating time)
Ah! You know who it is…

Finally

The one that takes me deeper
Soothingly
The way you walk on water
Gently
Your voice is always sweeter (sweeter)
Your voice is always sweeter
Verily-ly
Your smile is always purer
Lovely

When I met you at the alter
Truly-ly
There's no one else like you
I raise my glass to you (you, you)

Because you drink from the water
All of us
We drink from the water together
I like the way you show the ladder
(to) Higher

And because of you we gather

So thank the Lord for you
Hip Hip Hip Loke Loke Loke
Hip Hip Hip (Hey!)

Loke Loke Loke
Hip Hip Hip Loke Loke Loke
Hip Hip Hip Hey… Hey!
Hip Hip Hip Loke Loke Loke
Hip Hip Hip Loke Loke Loke
Hip Hip Hip Loke Loke Loke

Hip Hip Hip
We thank the Lord for You
Ah, so inspiring
So that I keep admiring
Never tiring
The way you keep on rising
A life of glory
Unending songs of victory
Dancing merrily
You know we can't control it
Because you drink from the water
All of us
We drink from the water together
I like the way you show the ladder
(to) Higher
And because of you we gather
So thank the Lord for you
