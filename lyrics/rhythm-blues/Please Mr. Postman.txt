Wait!
Oh yes, wait just a minute Mr. Postman
Wait!
Wait Mr. Postman

Mr. Postman, look and see
(Oh yeah)
If there's a letter in your bag for me
(Please, please Mr. Postman)
I've been waiting a long long time
(Oh yeah)
Since I heard from that gal of mine

There must be some word someday
From my girlfriend so far away
Please Mr. Postman look and see
If there's a letter, a letter for me

I've been standing here waiting Mr. Postman
So-o-o patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Saying she's returning home to me
Please Mr. Postman

Mr. Postman, look and see
(Oh yeah)
If there's a letter in your bag for me
(Please, please Mr. Postman)
I've been waiting a long long time
(Oh yeah)
Since I heard from that gal of mine

So many days you passed me by
Trail of tears standing in my eye
You didn't stop to make me feel better
Mr. Postman

Mr. Postman, look and see
Is there a letter in your bag for me?
(Oh yeah for me)
I've been waiting such a long time
Since I heard from that girlfriend of mine

You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
(Mr. Postman)
Wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
(Mr. Postman)
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
(Mr. Postman)
Check it and see, one more time for me

You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
(Mr. Postman)
Wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
(Mr. Postman)
Mr. Postman, oh yeah
(Wait a minute, wait a minute Mr. Postman)
Deliver the letter, the sooner the better

You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
(Mr. Postman)
Wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
(Mr. Postman)
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
(Mr. Postman)
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute
