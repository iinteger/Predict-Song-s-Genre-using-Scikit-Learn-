I don't like you, but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinkin' of you
Though you treat me badly, I love you madly

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(Really got a hold on me)

Baby, I don't like you, but I need you
Don't wanna kiss you, but I need to
Though you do me wrong now, my love is strong now

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(Really got a hold on me)

Baby, I love you and all I want you to do is just
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Tighter, tighter

I wanna leave you, don't wanna stay here
Don't wanna spend another day here
Though I gotta split now, I can't quit now

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(Really got a hold on me)

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(Really got a hold on me)

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(Really got a hold on me)

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(Really got a hold on me)
