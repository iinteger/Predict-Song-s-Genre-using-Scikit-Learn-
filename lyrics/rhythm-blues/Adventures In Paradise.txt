I believe any dream that I want to
That ain't the only way of keeping hope alive
And if by chance I give birth to my visions
Life is so fantastic it will come as no surprise
'Cause everyday is adventures in paradise
Woven well through the fabrics of time

I believe I am free, let it free me
That ain't the only way of getting past the jive
And every day something magical passes
Sunshine on my body, rainbows bloomin' in the sky
'Cause everyday is adventures in paradise
It is real if it's only in your mind
In your mind

It is real if it's only in your mind
In your mind
Step this way for another adventure in paradise
