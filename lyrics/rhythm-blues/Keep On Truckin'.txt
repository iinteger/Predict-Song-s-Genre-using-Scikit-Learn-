Keep on truckin', baby
I got to keep on truckin'
Got to get to your good lovin'

Shame
A double shame on me, yeah
Love
Love, I let it control me, yeah

I've got a fever rising with desire
It's my love jones and I feel like I'm on fire

And I'll keep on truckin', baby
I got to keep on truckin'
I got to get to your good lovin'

Feelin' good

I'm the red ball express of lovin'
Diesel-powered straight to you, I'm truckin'
In old Temptation's rain, I'm duckin'
For your love through sleet and snow, I'm truckin'

Ain't nothin' holdin' me back, nothin'
I'll keep right on, right on truckin'
Ain't nothin' holdin' me back, nothin'
I'll keep right on, right on truckin'
