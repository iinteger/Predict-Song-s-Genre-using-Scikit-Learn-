You can dance
Every dance with the guy
Who gave you the eye
Let him hold you tight

You can smile
Every smile for the man
Who held your hand
'Neath the pale moonlight

But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So Darlin'
Save the last dance for me

Mmmmmh'

Oh I know (Oh I know)
That the music's fine (Yes I know)
Like sparkling wine (Oh I know)
Go and have your fun (Yes I know)
(Oh I know) Laugh and sing
(Yes I know) But while we're apart
(Oh I know) Don't give your heart
(Yes I know) To anyone (Oh I know)

But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So Darlin'
Save the last dance for me

Mmmmh'

Baby don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never never let you go
I love oh so much

You can dance (You can dance)
Go and carry on
'Till the night is gone
And it's time to go

If he asks
If you're all alone
Can he take you home
You must tell him no

'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So Darlin'
Save the last dance for me
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So Darlin'
Save the last dance for me
Mmmh'
Save the last dance for me
Mmmm'
Save the last dance for me
