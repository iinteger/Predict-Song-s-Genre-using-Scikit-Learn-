Just let me tell you now
When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look
Oh baby, give me one more chance
(Show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart

Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms
(I want you back)
Yes, I do now
(I want you back)
Ooh ooh, baby
(I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I want you back)
Na na na na
Tryin' to live without your love is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on, I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl, I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now
Oh baby, all I need is one more chance
(Show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms
All I want
all I need
All I want
all I need
Baby
Oh
Baby
Oh, baby I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
Yes, I do now
(I want you back)
Oh, oh baby
(I want you back)
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I want you back)
nananana
Oh baby all I need is one more chance
(Show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
back in your heart
oh darling I was blind to let you go
(let you go baby)
But now since I see you in his arms
All I want
All I need
All I want
All I need
oh, baby
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
Oh baby,
I need one more chance
