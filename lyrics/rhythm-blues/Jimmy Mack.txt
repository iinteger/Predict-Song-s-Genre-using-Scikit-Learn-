Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
Oh, Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?

My arms are missin' you
My lips feel the same way too
I've tried so hard to be true
Like I promised I'd do
But this boy keeps a comin' 'round
He's tryin' to wear my resistance down

Hey Jimmy, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
Jimmy, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
You better

He calls me on the phone
About three times a day
No, my heart's not listen' to
What he has to say
But this loneliness I have within
Keeps reachin' out to be his friend

Hey Jimmy, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
Jimmy, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
You better hurry back

Need your lovin'
Won't you hurry back
Need your lovin'
Jimmy Mack, you better hurry back

I wanna say
I'm not gettin' any stronger
I can't hold back very much longer
Tryin' hard to be true
But, Jimmy, he talks jus' as sweet as you

Hey Jimmy, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
Jimmy, can't you hear me, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
You better hurry back

Need your lovin'
Jimmy Mack
Need your lovin'
Jimmy

Hey oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
Jimmy Mack
You better hurry back

Oh, I'm not gettin' any stronger
I can't hold back very much longer
Jimmy Mack
You better hurry back
