I've heard people say that too much of anything
Is not good for you, baby, but I don't know about that
As many times as we've loved and
We've shared love and made love
It doesn't seem to me like it's enough
It's just not enough, no, it's just not enough, oh baby

My darling, I can't get enough of your love, baby
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe
Some things I can't get used to, no matter how I try
It's like the more you give, the more I want
And baby, that's no lie, oh no, baby

Tell me, what can I say, what am I gonna do?
How should I feel when everything is you?
What kind of love is this that you're givin' me
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?

Girl, all I know is every time you're near
I feel the change, something's movin'
I scream your name, look what you you got me doin'

Darling, I can't get enough of your love, baby
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, baby, oh no, baby
Girl, if I could only make you see and make you understand
Girl, your love for me is all I need
And more than I can stand, oh well, baby

How can I explain all the things I feel
You've given me so much, girl, you're so unreal
Still I keep loving you, more and more each time
Girl, what am I gonna do 'cause you blow my mind

I get the same old feeling every time you're here
I feel the change, something moves
I scream your name, look what you you got me doing

Darling, I can't get enough of your love, baby
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, baby
Oh my darling, I can't get enough of your love, baby, oh baby
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, baby
Darling, I can't get enough of your love, baby
