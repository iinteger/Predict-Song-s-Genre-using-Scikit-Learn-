Hold it, everybody
Hold it, hold it, listen

I can turn the gray sky blue
I can make it rain whenever I want it to
Oh, I can build a castle from a single grain of sand
I can make a ship sail, huh, on dry land

But my life is incomplete and I'm so blue
'Cause I can't get next to you

Next to you
I just can't get next you

I can fly like a bird in the sky
Hey, and I can buy anything that money can buy
Oh, I can turn a river into a raging fire
I can live forever if I so desire

Unimportant are all the things I can do
'Cause I can't get next to you

No matter what I do
Uh-yah

Ooh
Ooh
Chicka boom, chicka boom
Chicka boom, boom, boom

I can turn back the hands of time
You better believe I can
I can make the seasons change just by waving my hand
Oh, I can change anything from old to new
The things I want to do the most, I'm unable to do

Unhappy am I with all the powers I possess
'Cause girl you're the key to my happiness
And I can't get next to you

Girl, you're blowing my mind
'Cause I can't get [(next to you)]
Can't you see these tears I'm crying?
I can't get [(next to you)]
Girl, it's you that I need
I gotta get [(next to you)]
Can't you see these tears I'm crying?
I can't get [(next to you)]
I, I, I, I
I can't get [(next to you)]
I, I, I, I
I can't get [(next to you)]
Girl, you're blowing my mind
