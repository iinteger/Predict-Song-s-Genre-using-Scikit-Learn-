Fever
(Davenport/Colby)

as performed by Little Willie John

Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a feeling that's so hard to bear

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
And fever all through the night

Listen to me baby
Hear every word I say
No one can love you the way I do
Cus they don't know how to love you my way

(chorus:)
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
And fever all through the night

Bless my soul I love you
Take this heart away
Take these arms I'll never use
And just believe in what my lips have to say

[chorus]

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
My eyes light up when you call my name
Cus I know your gonna treat me right

[chorus]
