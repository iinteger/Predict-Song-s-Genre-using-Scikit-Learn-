Well now lawdy, lawdy, lawdy, Miss Clawdy
Girl, you sure look good to me
Well, please don't excite me baby
Know it can't be me

Because I gave you all my money
Girl, but you just won't treat me right
You like to ball in the mornin'
Don't come back till late at night

I'm gonna tell, tell my mama
Girl I'm gonna tell what you doing to me
I'm gonna tell everybody
That I'm down in misery

Well lawdy, lawdy, lawdy, Miss Clawdy
Girl you sure look good to me
You just wheel and rockin' baby
Just as fine as you can be

Well so bye, bye-bye, baby
Girl, I won't be comin' no more
Bye darlin', I'm dying
Down the road I go
