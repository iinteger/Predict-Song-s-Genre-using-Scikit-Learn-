Express yourself
Express yourself

You don’t ever need help from nobody else
All you got to do now
Express yourself

Whatever you do
Do it good
Whatever you do, do, do, Lord, Lord
Do it good, all right

It’s not what you look like
When you’re doin', what you’re doin'
It’s what you’re doin', when you’re doin'
What you look like you’re doin'

Express yourself
Express yourself

They’re doin' it on the moon
In the jungle too, everybody on the floor now
Jumpin' like a kangaroo
So let the horns do the thing they do

Some people have everything
And other people don’t
But everything don’t mean a thing
If it ain't the thing you want

Express yourself
Express yourself

Oh, do it, oh, do it
Do it to it, go on and do it
Yo, do it, give

Express yourself
Express yourself

Do it, oh Lord
Do it, yeah

Express yourself
Express yourself
Express yourself
