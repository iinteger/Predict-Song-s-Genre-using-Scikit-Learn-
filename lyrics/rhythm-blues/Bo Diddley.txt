Bo Diddley bought his baby a diamond ring
If that diamond ring don't shine
He gonna take it to a private eye
If that private eye can't see
He better not take the ring from me

Bo Diddley bought a nanny goat
To make his pretty baby a Sunday coat
Bo Diddley bought a bear-a-cat
To make his pretty baby a Sunday hat

Mojo come to my house, a black cat bone
And take my baby away from home
Ugly ole Mojo where's he been
Up to your house and gone again

Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley have you heard?
My pretty baby said she was a bird
