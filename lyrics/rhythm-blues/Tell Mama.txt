You thought you had found a good girl
One to love you and give you the world
Now you find that you've been misused
Talk to me, I'll do what you choose, I want you to

Tell Mama all about it
Tell Mama what you need
Tell Mama what you want
And I'll make everything alright

That girl you had didn't have no sense
She wasn't worth all the time that you spent
She had another man throw you outdoors
Now the same man is wearing your clothes, I want you to

Tell Mama all about it
Tell Mama what you need
Tell Mama what you want
And I'll make everything alright

Tell me, tell me now

She would embarrass you anywhere
She'd let everybody know she didn't care
Give me a chance I've been beggin' you
And I just want to take care of you, I want you to

Tell Mama all about it
Tell Mama what you need
Tell Mama what you want
Tell Mama what you want right now

Tell me, tell your mom
I'm your Mama
Tell me what you want
