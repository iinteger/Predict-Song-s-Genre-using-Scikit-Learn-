Say it's all right, say it's all right
It's all right, have a good time
'Cause it's all right, whoa, it's all right
We're gonna move it slow, when lights are low
When you move it slow, it sounds like more
And it's all right, whoa, it's all right
Now, listen to the beat, kinda pat your feet
You got soul and everybody knows
That it's all right, whoa, it's all right
When you wake up early in the mornin'
Feelin' sad like so many of us do
Hum a little soul, make life your goal
And surely something's got to come to you
And say it's all right, say it's all right
It's all right, have a good time
'Cause it's all right, whoa, it's all right
Now, everybody clap your hands
Give yourself a chance
You got soul and everybody knows
That it's all right, whoa, it's all right
Someday I'll find me a woman
Who will love and treat me real nice
Then my woe's got to go
And my love, she will know
From morning, noon and night
And she's got to
Say it's all right, say it's all right
It's all right, have a good time
'Cause it's all right, whoa, it's all right
Everybody clap your hands
Now, give yourself a chance
You got soul
