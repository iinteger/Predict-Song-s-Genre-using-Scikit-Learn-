Superstition
by Jeff Beck

Very superstitious, writing's on the wall.
Very superstitious, ladder's 'bout to fall.
Thirteen-month-old baby broke the looking glass.
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past.
When you believe in things that you don't understand, then you suffer.
Superstition ain't the way.
Hey, hey, hey.

Ooh, very superstitious, wash your face and hands.
Rid me of the problem, do all that you can.
Keep me in a daydream, keep me goin' strong.
You don't wanna save me, sad is my song.
When you believe in things that you don't understand, then you suffer.
Superstition ain't the way.
Hey, hey, hey.

Very superstitious, nothing more to say.
Very superstitious, the devil's on his way.
Thirteen-month-old baby broke the looking glass.
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past.
When you believe in things that you don't understand, then you suffer.
Superstition ain't the way.
Hey, hey, hey.
Very superstitious.
