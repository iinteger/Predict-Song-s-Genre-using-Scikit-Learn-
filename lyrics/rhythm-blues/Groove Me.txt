Girl, I've been trying to say, now
You look so sweet
And you're so doggone fine
I just can't get you out of my mind

You've become a sweet taste in my mouth, now
And I want you to be my spouse
So that we can live happily, nah-nah
In a great big ol' roomy house

And I know you're gonna groove me, baby
Ah, yeah, now

Come on and groove me, baby

With plenty, plenty hugging
Ooh, you cute little thang, you

No other man, no other girl
Can enter into our world
