Mama, he treats your daughter mean
Mama, he treats your daughter mean
Mama, he treats your daughter mean
He's the meanest man I've ever seen

Mama, he treats me badly
Makes me love him madly
Mama, he takes my money
Makes me call him honey

Mama, he can't be trusted
Makes me so disgusted
All of my friends say they don't understand
What's the matter with this man

I tell you Mama, he treats your daughter mean
Mama, he treats your daughter mean
Mama, he treats your daughter mean
He's the mean, meanest man I've ever seen

Mama, this man is lazy
Almost drives me crazy
Mama, he makes me squeeze him
Still my squeeze don't please him

Mama, my heart is aching
I believe it's breaking
Mama, I've stood through all that, I can stand
What's the matter with this man?

I tell you Mama, he treats your daughter mean
Mama, he treats your daughter mean
Mama, he treats your daughter mean
He's the mean, meanest man I've ever seen
