So long ago I don't remember when
That's when they say I lost my only friend
Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
As I listened through the cemetery trees

I seen the sun coming up at the funeral at dawn
The long broken arm of human law
Now it always seemed such a waste
She always had a pretty face
I wondered why she hung around this place

Hey, come on try a little, nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than in the middle
But me and Cinderella we put it all together
We can drive it home with one headlight

She said it's cold, it feels like Independence Day
And I can't break away from this parade
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed

And I seen the sign up ahead at the county line bridge
Saying all is good and nothingness is dead
Run until she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothing left
She hit the end, it's just her window ledge

Hey, come on try a little, nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than in the middle
But me and Cinderella we put it all together
We can drive it home with one headlight

Well this place is old, it feels just like a beat up truck
I turn the engine but the engine doesn't turn
Well it smells of cheap wine and cigarettes
This place is always such a mess
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn

I'm so alone and I feel just like somebody else
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between
These city walls of dying dreams
I think her death it must be killing me

Hey, hey, hey! Come on try a little, nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than in the middle
But me and Cinderella we put it all together
We can drive it home with one headlight
