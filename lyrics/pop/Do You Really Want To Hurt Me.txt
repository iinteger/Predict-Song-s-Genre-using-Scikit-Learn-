Give me time
To realize my crime
Let me love and steal
I have danced inside your eyes
How can I be real

Do you really want to hurt me
Do you really want to make me cry

Precious kisses, words that burn me
Lovers never ask you why
In my heart the fire's burnin'
Choose my color find a star
Precious people always tell me
That's a step, a step too far

Do you really want to hurt me
Do you really want to make me cry
Do you really want to hurt me
Do you really want to make me cry

Words are few I have spoken
I could waste a thousand years
Wrapped in sorrow words are token
Come inside and catch my tears

You've been talkin' but believe me
If its true you do not know
This boy loves without a reason
I'm prepared to let you go

If it's love you want from me
Then take it away
Everything is not what you see
It's over again

Do you really want to hurt me

Cry, cry, cry
