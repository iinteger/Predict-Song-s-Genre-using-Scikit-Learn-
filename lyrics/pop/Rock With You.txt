Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do

Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine
You got to feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you all night
Dance you into day, sunlight
I wanna rock with you all night
We're gonna rock the night away

Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love

Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go
When you feel that heat
And we gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you all night
Dance you into day, sunlight
I wanna rock with you all night
We gon' rock the night away

And when the groove
Is dead and gone, yeah
You know that love survives
So we can rock forever on

I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you
I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you

I wanna rock all night with you
Girl, sunlight, rock with you
Rock with you, all night, yeah
Dance the night away

I wanna rock with you, yeah, all night
Rock you into day, sunlight
I wanna rock with you all night
Rock the night away

Feel the heat, feel the beat, all night
Rock you into day sunlight
I wanna rock all night
Rock the night away
