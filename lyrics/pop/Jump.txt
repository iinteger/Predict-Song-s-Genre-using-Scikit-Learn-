I get up and nothin' gets me down
You got it tough, well, I've seen the toughest around
And I know, baby, just how you feel
You got to roll with the punches to get to what's real

Ah, can't ya see me standin' here?
I got my ass against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Ah, can't ya see what I mean?

I might as well jump, jump
Go ahead an' jump
I said jump
I might as well jump

You don't know
You don't know until you begin

Now can't ya see me standing here?
I got my ass against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
You don't know what I mean?

I might as well jump, jump
Go ahead and jump
I said jump, jump
Go ahead and jump

Come on babe
Jump on, jump on
Jump on, jump on

Jump on
Jump on
Jump on

Might as well jump, jump
Go ahead and jump, baby
I said jump, jump
Jump on, jump on

Get up and jump
I said jump, jump
I said jump, I said jump
Jump on, jump on
Jump on, jump on
Come on babe, I said jump
