Hey look
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to drive my imagination
I can't get no, no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm watchin' my TV
And a man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts can be
Well he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
I try and I try and I try and I try try try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm ridin' round the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm signing that
And I'm tryin' to make some girl
Who tells me baby better come back later next week
You see I'm on losing streak
I can't get no, no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say

I
Do some
[Incomprehensible] satisfaction
I won't get satisfaction
We don't get satisfaction
You don't see satisfaction

[Incomprehensible]
Hey, I say

[Incomprehensible]
Yeah
Yeah
