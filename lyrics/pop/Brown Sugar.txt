Gold Coast slave ship bound for cotton fields
Sold in a market down in New Orleans
Scarred old slaver know he's doin' alright
Hear him whip the women just around midnight

Brown sugar, how come you taste so good
Brown sugar, just like a young girl should

Drums beating, cold English blood runs hot
Lady of the house wonderin' where it's gonna stop
House boy knows that he's doin' alright
You should a heard him just around midnight

Brown sugar, how come you taste so good
Brown sugar, just like a young girl should


Brown sugar, how come you taste so good
Brown sugar, just like a black girl should

I bet your mama was a Tent Show queen
And all her boyfriends were sweet sixteen
I'm no school boy but I know what I like
You should have heard me just around midnight

Brown sugar, how come you taste so good
Brown sugar, just like a young girl should


I said yeah, I said yeah, I said yeah, I said oh
Just like a black girl should
