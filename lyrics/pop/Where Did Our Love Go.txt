Baby, baby, baby
Baby don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself

I've got this burning, burning, yearning
Feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad

You came into my heart
So tenderly
With a burning love
That stings like a bee

Now that I surrender
So helplessly
You now wanna leave
Ooh, you wanna leave me

Ooh, baby, baby
Where did our love go?
Ooh, don't you want me
Don't you want me no more? Ooh, baby

Baby, baby
Where did our love go?
And all your promises
I'll love ya ever more

I've got this burning, burning, yearning
Feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad

Before you won my heart
You were a perfect guy
And I'll let you guide me
You wanna leave me behind

Ooh, baby, baby, baby
Baby, don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself

Ooh, baby, baby
Baby, don't
