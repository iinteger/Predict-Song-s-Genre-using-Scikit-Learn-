She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky

Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Woa ohh ohh
Sweet child o' mine
Woa oh oh oh
Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

But her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by, aye

Woa ohh ohh
Sweet child of mine
Ooh woa oh oh oh
Sweet love of mine

Ooh ooh ooh
Aah ooh ohh ohh yeah
Woa oh oh oh
Sweet child o' mine
Ooo woa oh oh oh
Sweet love of mine

Woa oh oh oh
Sweet child of mine
Ooo yea ehh
Ooo ooh sweet love of mine

Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Hmm ooh ohh
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Ohh where do we go now
Where do we go
Sweet child where do we go now

Aai aai aai aai aai aai aai aai aai

Ooh where do we go now
Aah aah aah aah ohh ohh
Where do we go

Aah aah aah aah aa aa aa aa
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Ohh where do we go now
Now now now now now now now
Sweet child o' mine
Sweet child of mine
