I've been holding out so long
I've been sleeping all alone
Lord, I miss you

I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I want to kiss you

Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
Lord, I miss you

I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings

It's just some friends of mine that say
"Hey, what's the matter man?
We're gonna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls that's just dyin' to meet you"

"We're gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around
You know, like we used to"

Oh, everybody waits so long
Oh baby, why you wait so long?
Won't you come home, come home?

I've been walking Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy

Stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Ask me people, "What's the matter with you boy?"

Sometimes I want to say to myself
Sometimes I say

I won't miss you child

I guess I'm lying to myself
It's just you and no one else
Lord, I won't keep you child

You've been blotting out my mind
Fooling on my time
No, I won't miss you, baby, yeah

Lord, I miss you child
Lord, I miss you child
Lord, I miss you child
