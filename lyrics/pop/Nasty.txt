Give me a beat!

Sittin' in the movie show, thinkin' nasty thoughts, uh
Better be a gentleman or you'll turn me off, uh
That's right, let me tell you

Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing, uh
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change, uh
Oh you nasty boys

I don't like no nasty car, I don't like nasty food, uh
The only nasty thing I like is a nasty groove, uh
Will this one do?
Uh huh, I know say

Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing, uh
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change, uh
Oh you nasty boys

Nasty, nasty boys give me a nasty groove, uh
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys let me see your nasty body move, uh
Oh you nasty boys

I could learn to like this
Listen up

I'm not a prude, I just want some respect
So close the door if you want me to respond
'Cause privacy is my middle name
My last name is control
No, my first name ain't baby, it's Janet
Ms. Jackson if you're nasty

Nasty boys, don't mean a thing, uh
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty boys, don't ever change, uh
Oh you nasty boys

Nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys don't mean a thing to me, uh
Don't mean a thing, uh
Oh you nasty boys, uh

I love this part

Hey! Who's that thinkin' nasty thoughts?
Nasty boys!
Who's that in that nasty car?
Nasty boys!
Who's that eatin' that nasty fruit?
Nasty boys!
Who's jammin' to my nasty groove?
Nasty boys!

Ladies? Nasty boys don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys
