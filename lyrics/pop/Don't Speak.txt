You and me
We used to be together
Every day together always
I really feel
That I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end
It looks as though you're letting go
And if it's real
Well I don't want to know
Don't speak

I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Our memories

They can be inviting
But some are altogether mighty frightening
As we die, both you and I
With my head in my hands I sit and cry
Don't speak

I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
(no, no, no) Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

It's all ending
I gotta stop pretending who we are
You and me

I can see us dying ... are we?
Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

(No, no) Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
I know what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't speak
Don't speak
Don't speak (no)
I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
I know you're good
I know you're good
I know your real good
Don't, don't
Hush, hush, darling
Don't tell 'cause hurts
Hush, hush, darling
