You have so many relationships in this life
Only one of two will last
You're going through all this pain and strife
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast
And they're gone so fast
So hold on to the ones that really care
In the end they'll be the only ones there
When you get old and start losing your hair
Can you tell me who will still care
Can you tell me who will still care

Mmm bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop

Mmm bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba du bop
Ba du bop, ba du bop
Ba du 

Plant a seed, plant a flower, plant a rose
You can plant any one of those
Keep planting to find out which one grows
It's a secret no one knows
It's a secret no one knows

Mmm bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop
Ba du
Mmm bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba du bop
Ba du bop, ba du bop
Ba du

In an mmm bop they're gone. In an mmmbop
they're not there.
In an mmmbop they're gone. In an mmmbop 
they're not there.
Until you lose your hair. But you don't care.

Mmm bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop

Mmm bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba du bop
Ba du bop, ba du bop

Can you tell me? You say you can but you don't know.
Can you tell me which flower's going to grow?
Can you tell me if it's going to be a daisy or a rose?
Can you tell me which flower's going to grow?
Can you tell me? You say you can but you don't know.
