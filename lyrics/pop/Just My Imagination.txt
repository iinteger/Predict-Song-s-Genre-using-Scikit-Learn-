Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself, "You're such a lucky guy"
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all the fellas in the world she belongs to me

But it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

Soon, soon we'll be married and raise a family
A cozy, little home out in the country
With two children, maybe three
I tell you, I can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems

But it was just my imagination, once again
Runnin' away with me
I tell you it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

Every night, on my knees I pray
"Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me
Or I will surely die"

Her love is Heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality, she doesn't even know me

Just my imagination, once again
Runnin' away with me
I tell you it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

I never met her, but I can't forget her
Just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
Just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
