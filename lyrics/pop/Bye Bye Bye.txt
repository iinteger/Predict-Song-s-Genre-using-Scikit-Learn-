Hey, hey
Bye, bye
Bye, bye
Oh oh.

I'm doin' this tonight
You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey baby come on

I loved you endlessly
When you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave and make it alone

I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby bye, bye, bye

Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
'Cause you may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby bye, bye, bye

Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy
But it ain't no lie
Baby bye, bye, bye

(Oh, Oh)
Just hit me with the truth
Now, girl you're more than welcome to
So give me one good reason
Baby come on

I live for you and me
And now I really come to see
That life would be much better once you're gone

I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby bye, bye, bye

Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby bye, bye, bye

Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy
But it ain't no lie
Baby bye, bye, bye

I'm giving up I know for sure
I don't wanna be the reason for your love no more
I'm checkin' out and I'm signin' off
Don't wanna be the loser and I've had enough

I don't wanna be a fool in this game for two
So I'm leavin' you behind
Bye, bye, bye
I don't wanna make it tough (Make it tough)
But I've had enough
Bye, bye, bye
I don't wanna be a fool for you (I don't wanna be a fool)
Just another player in your game for two
I don't wanna a be your fool
But it ain't no lie baby
Bye, bye, bye
I don't really wanna make it tough (I don't wanna make it tough)
I just wanna tell you that I've had enough
Might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Bye, bye, bye
