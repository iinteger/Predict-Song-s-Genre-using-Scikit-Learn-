End of the spring and here she comes back
Hi, hi, hi, hi there
Them summer days, those summer days

That's when I had most of my fun back
High, high, high, high there
Them summer days, those summer days

I 'Cloud nine' when I want to
Out of school, yeah
County fair in the country sun
And everything, it's true, ooh, yeah, yeah

Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime

First of the fall and then she goes back
Bye, bye, bye, bye there
Them summer days, those summer days

'Boop-boop-ba-boop-boop' when I want to
Out of school
County fair in the country sun
And everything, it's cool, ooh, yeah

Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime
