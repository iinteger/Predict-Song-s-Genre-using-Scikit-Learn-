Soft Cell
Miscellaneous
Tainted Love
Sometimes I feel I've got to. . . run away,
I've got to. . . get away
&gt;From the pain you drive into the heart of me.
The love we share seems to go nowhere,
And I've lost my life,
For I toss and turn; I can't sleep at night.

Chorus:
Once I ran to you, now I run from you.
This tainted love you've given,
I gave you all a boy could give you.
Take my tears and that's not really all. . .
Tainted love, ohh, tainted love

Now I know I've got to. . . run away,
I've got to. . . get away.
You don't really want any more from me.
To make things right you need someone to  hold you tight,
And you think love is to pray,
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way.

Chorus

Don't touch me please, I cannot stand the way you tease.
I love you though you hurt me so.
Now I'm gonna pack my things and go.

Ohh, tainted love (repeat)

Touch me baby, tainted love (repeat &amp; fade out)
