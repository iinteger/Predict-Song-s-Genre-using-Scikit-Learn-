At home, drawing pictures of mountain tops
With him on top, lemon yellow sun, arms raised in a V
And the dead lay in pools of maroon below

Father didn't give attention, oh
And the boy was something that mother wouldn't wear
King Jeremy, the wicked, oh, ruled his world

Clearly I remember pickin' on the boy, seemed a harmless little fuck
Ooh, but we unleashed a lion, yeah
Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast
How could I forget?

And he hit me with a surprise left
My jaw left hurtin', ooh, dropped wide open
Just like the day, oh, like the day I heard

Father didn't give affection, no
And the boy to the fact that mother didn't care
King Jeremy, the wicked, oh, ruled his world

Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today

Try to forget this, try to forget this
Try to erase this, try to forget this
From the blackboard

Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today

Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in class today
