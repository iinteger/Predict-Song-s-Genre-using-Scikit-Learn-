Papa, I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now
I'm not a baby

You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, Daddy, please be strong
I may be young at heart
But I know what I'm saying

The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess and I don't mean maybe
Please

Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Oh, I'm gonna keep my baby, mmm

He says that he's going to marry me
We can raise a little family
Maybe, we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice

But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now is some good advice
Please

Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh oh

Daddy, Daddy, if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love, we are in love
  (In love so)
So please

Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh ah

Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep

(Papa don't preach)
Oh, I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh
  (Papa don't preach)
Don't you stop loving me, Daddy
  (Papa don't preach)
I know, I'm keeping my baby
  (Papa don't preach)
