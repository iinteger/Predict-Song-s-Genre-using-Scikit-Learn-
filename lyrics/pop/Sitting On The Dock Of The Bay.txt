Sitting in the morning sun
I'll be sitting when the evening come
Watching the ships roll in
And I'll watch 'em roll away again, yeah

I'm sitting on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away, ooh
I'm just sitting on the dock of the bay
Wasting time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco bay
I have nothing to live for
Look like nothings gonna come my way

So I'm just go sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm sitting on the dock of the bay
Wasting time

Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remain the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess, I'll remain the same, yes

Sitting here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, yes
Two thousand miles I roam
Just to make this dock my home

Now I'm just go sit at the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away, ooh
Sitting on the dock of the bay
Wasting time
