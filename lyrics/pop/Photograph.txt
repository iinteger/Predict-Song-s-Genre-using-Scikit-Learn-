I'm outta luck, outta love
Gotta photograph, picture of
Passion killer, you're too much
You're the only one, I wanna touch

I see your face every time I dream
On every page, every magazine
So wild and free so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy

Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh, look what you've done

Photograph, I don't want your
Photograph, I don't need your
Photograph, all I've got is a photograph
But it's not enough

I'd be your lover, if you were there
Put your hurt on me, if you dare
Such a woman, you got style
You make every man feel like a child, oh

You got some kinda hold on me
You're all wrapped up in mystery
So wild so free and far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy

Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh, look what you've done
I gotta have you

Photograph, I don't want your
Photograph, I don't need your
Photograph, all I've got is a photograph
You've gone straight to my head

Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh, look what you've done
I gotta have you

Photograph, I don't want your
Photograph, I don't need your
Photograph, all I've got is a photograph
I wanna touch you, oh

Photograph
Photograph, your photograph
Photograph
Photograph, I need only your
Photograph, I'm outta love
Photograph, I'm outta love
Photograph, you're the only one
Photograph, I wanna touch
Photograph
