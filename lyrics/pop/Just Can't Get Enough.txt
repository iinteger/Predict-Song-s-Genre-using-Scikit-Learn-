When I'm with you baby
I go out of my head
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

All the things you do to me
And everything you said
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

We walk together
We're walking down the street
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

Every time I think of you
I know we have to meet
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

It's getting hotter, it's a burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

And when it rains
You're shining down for me
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Just like a rainbow
You know you set me free
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
You're like an angel and you give me your love
And I just can't seem to get enough of
Just can't seem to get enough
Just can't seem to get enough
Just can't seem to get enough
Just can't seem to get enough
Just can't seem to get enough
Just can't seem to get enough
Just can't seem to get enough
Just can't seem to get enough
Just can't seem to get enough
Just can't seem to get enough
Just can't seem to get enough
Just can't seem to get enough
Just can't seem to get enough
Just can't seem to get enough
Just can't seem to get enough
Just can't seem to get enough
