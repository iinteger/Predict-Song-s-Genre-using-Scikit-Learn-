Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That somethin' wasn't right?

Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're outta sight

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now
Oh because

My loneliness is killin' me
I must confess I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Now, boy you got me blinded

I bet you baby
There's nothing that I would not do, no
It's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now
Oh because

My loneliness is killin' me
I must confess I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me baby one more time

Oh baby baby, oh baby baby
Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go

I must confess that my lonliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe?
That you will be here and give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

My loneliness is killin' me
I must confess I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me baby one more time

I must confess that my lonliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe?
That you will be here and give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
