Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do, nowhere to go
I wanna be sedated

Just get me to the airport
Put me on a plane
Hurry hurry hurry, before I go insane
I can't control my fingers
I can't control my brain, oh no

Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do, nowhere to go
I wanna be sedated

Just put me in a wheelchair
And get me on a plane
Hurry hurry hurry, before I go insane
I can't control my fingers
I can't control my brain, oh no

Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go

Get me to the show
Hurry hurry hurry, before I go loco
I can't control my fingers
I can't control my toes, oh no
