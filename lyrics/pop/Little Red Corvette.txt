I guess I shoulda known
By the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last

See you're the kinda person
That believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast

I guess I must be dumb
'Cuz you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used

But it was Saturday night
I guess that makes it all right
And you say what have I got to lose?
And honey I say

Little red Corvette, baby, you're much too fast
Little red Corvette, you need a love that's gonna last

I guess I shoulda closed my eyes
When you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free

'Cuz I felt a little ill
When I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me

Believe it or not
I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class

But it was Saturday night
I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "Baby, have you got enough gas?"
Oh yeah

Little red Corvette, baby, you're much too fast, yes, you are
Little red Corvette, you need to find a love that's gonna last, how long?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

A body like yours oughta be in jail
'Cuz it's on the verge of bein' obscene
Move over baby, gimme the keys
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine

Little red Corvette, baby, you're much too fast
Little red Corvette, you need to find a love that's gonna last
Little red Corvette, honey, you got to slow down
(Got to slow down)
Little red Corvette, 'cuz if you don't you gonna run into [Incomprehensible]

Little red Corvette, right down to the ground
(Honey you got to slow down)
You, you, got to slow down
Little red Corvette, you're movin' much too fast
Too fast, you need to find a love that's gonna last

Girl, you got an ass like I never seen
And the ride, I say the ride is so smooth
You must be a limousine
Baby, you're much too fast

Little red Corvette, you need a love
You need a love that's ah, that's gonna last
Little red Corvette, you got to slow down
(You got to slow down)

Little red Corvette, 'cuz if you don't, 'cuz if you don't
You gonna run your body right into the ground
Right into the ground, right into the ground
Right into the ground, little red Corvette
