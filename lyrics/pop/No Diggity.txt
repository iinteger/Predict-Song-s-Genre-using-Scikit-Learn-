Hey, yeah ya know what?
I like the players
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette
Play on playette
Yo Dre drop the verse

It's going down fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me colab creations bump like acne
No doubt I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch
A dog couldn't catch me, ass out
Tell me who could stop with Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them ear-gasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor with the homeys Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly bitch, she don't play around
Cover much grounds got game by the pound
Gettin' paid is her forte
Each and every day true player way
I can't get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Pushin' fat rides it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up
Bag it up girl

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up

She's got class and style
Street knowledge, by the pound
Baby never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catching feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the fatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty bang bang to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, everyday
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby I can get you with my ride

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up
Bag it up girl

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up

Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
Hey yo that girl looks good
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
Play on play on player
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
You're my kind of girl
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
Hey yo

'Coz that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flying first class from NY City to Blackstreet
What chu know about me
Not a mothafuckin' thing
Cartier wooded frames supported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest click up on this scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt
I predicted so
Please excuse if I come across rude
That's just me and that's how a player's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block I'm as real as can be

Word is born faking moves never been my thing
So Teddy pass the word to your nigga Chauncey
I'll be sending a car, lets say around three thirty
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up
Bag it up girl

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up

Yeah, Come on, Jackie in full effect
Lisa in full effect, Nicky in full effect
Tomeka in full effect, ladies in full effect
Ain't nothing goin' on but the rent
Yeah play on play that
Play on play on, 'coz I like it
No diggity, no doubt, yeah
