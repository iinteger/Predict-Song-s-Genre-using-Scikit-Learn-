Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hittin' something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight
So stick around
You're gonna hear electric music
Solid walls of sound

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet, woo
But they're so spaced out, Be-Be-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really clean
She's got electric boots, a Mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, ooh ho
Be-Be-Bennie and the Jets

Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

Oh Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
Oh but they're so spaced out, Be-Be-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really clean
She's got electric boots, a Mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, ooh ho
Be-Be-Bennie and the Jets

Oh Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
Oh but they're so spaced out, Be-Be-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really clean
She's got electric boots, a Mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, ooh ho
Be-Be-Bennie and the Jets

Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets, Jets, Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
