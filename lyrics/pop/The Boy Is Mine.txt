The boy is mine
The boy is mine
The boy is mine
The boy is mine
The boy is mine

Excuse me can I please talk to you for a minute?
Uh hu sure you know you look kinda familiar
Yeah you do too, but I just wanted to know
Do you know somebody named?

Oh you know his name
Oh yeah definitely I know his name
Well I just want to let you that he's mine
Huh no no he's mine

You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine

Think it's time we got this straight
Sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man are you insane?

But see I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me

See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame?

But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took

You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine

Must you do the things you do
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me not you
And if you didn't know it's 'cause it's true

I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside

You can say what you wanna say
What we have you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake

When will you get the picture
You're the past I'm the future
Get away it's my time to shine
If you didn't know the boy is mine

You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine

You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine

You can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel

What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart
He was my love right from the start

You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine

You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine

You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine
