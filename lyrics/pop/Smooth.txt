Man it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My mu equita my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove
Yea

And if you say, "This life ain't good enough"
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it

I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word I hear your name callin' me out
Out from the barrio you hear my rhythm from your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round

And if you say, "This life ain't good enough"
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it

And just like the ocean under the moon
Well it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart make it real
Or else forget about it
Yeah

Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
(Gimme your heart make it real)
Or else forget about it
(yeah)
Let's don' forget about it
(Oh, no, no)
   (Oh)
Let's don' forget about it
(Oh, no, no)
   (Oh)
Let's don' forget about it
(yeah)
(Ahh, Ohh)
Let's don' forget about it
(Yeah, yeah)
