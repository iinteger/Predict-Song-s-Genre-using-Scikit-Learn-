I, I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

I'm picking up good vibrations
She's giving me the excitations
Good bop bop, good vibrations
Bop bop, excitations
Good, good, good, good vibrations
Good, good, good, good vibrations

Close my eyes, she is somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

I'm picking up good vibrations
She's giving me the excitations
Good bop bop, good vibrations
Bop bop, excitations
Good, good, good, good vibrations
Good, good, good, good vibrations

I, my, my
I don't know where but she sends me there
Oh, my, my, my, what a sensation
Oh, my, my, what elation

Got to keep those loving good vibrations
Happening with her
Got to keep those loving good vibrations
Happening with her

Got to keep those loving good vibrations
Happening with her
Got to keep those loving good vibrations
Happening

Good, good, good, good vibrations
Good, good, good, good vibrations
