Oh yeah
Mmm

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet

So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

Ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
(Don't want to be a richer man)

Ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
(Just gonna have to be a different man)

Time may change me
But I can't trace time

I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same

And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

Ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
(Don't tell them to grow up and out of it)

Ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
(Where's your shame, you've left us up to our necks in it)

Time may change me
But you can't trace time

Strange fascination, fascinating me
Ah changes are taking the pace I'm going through

Ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
(Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers)

Ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
(Pretty soon now you're gonna get older)

Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time
