I woke up this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away

It's more than a feeling
More than a feeling
When I hear that old song they used to play
More than a feeling
And I begin dreaming
More than a feeling
'Til I see Mary Ann walk away
I see my Mary Ann walkin' away

So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet I still recall as I wander on
As clear as the sun in the summer sky

It's more than a feeling
More than a feeling
When I hear that old song they used to play
More than a feeling
And I begin dreaming
More than a feeling
'Til I see Mary Ann walk away
I see my Maria Ann walkin' away

When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
And dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away
She slipped away

It's more than a feeling
More than a feeling
When I hear that old song they used to play
More than a feeling
And I begin dreaming
More than a feeling
'Til I see Mary Ann walk away
