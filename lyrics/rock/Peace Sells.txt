If there's a new way
I'll be the first in line
But, it better work this time

I didn't know you had any feelings
What do you mean, "I ain't kind?"
I'm just not your kind
What do you mean, "I couldn't be president,
Of the United States Of America?"
Tell me somethin', "It's still, we the people, right?"

If there's a new way
I'll be the first in line
But, it better work this time

Ohh
