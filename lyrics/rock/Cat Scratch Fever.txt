The first time that I got it

I got it from some kitty next foor 
I went and see the Dr. and 
He gave me the cure 
I think I got it some more

Cat scratch fever 

It's nothin dangerous 
I feel no pain 
I've got to ch-ch-change 
You know you got it when you're going insane 
It makes a grown man cryin' cryin' 
Won't you make my bed

The stroke of my hand 
They know they gettin' it from me 
They know just where to go 
When they need their lovin man 
They know I do it for free
