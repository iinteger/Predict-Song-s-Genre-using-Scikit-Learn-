I'm a streetwalking cheetah with a heart full of napalm
I'm a runaway son of a nuclear A-bomb

I am the world's forgotten boy
The one who searches and destroys

Honey gotta help me please
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby, detonate for me

Look out honey, 'cause i'm using technology
Ain't got time to make no apology

Solar radiation in the dead of night
Love in the middle of a fire fight

Honey gotta strike a plan
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby, penetrate my mind

I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy
And honey I'm the world's forgotten boy

The one who's searchin' only to destroy
Forgotten boy, forgotten boy
Forgotten boy said hey forgotten boy
