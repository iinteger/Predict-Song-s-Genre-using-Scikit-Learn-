You know I never, I've never seen you look so good
You never act the way you should
But I like it
And I know you like it too
The way that I want you
I've gotta have you
Oh yes I do
I never, I never ever stay out late
You know that I can hardly wait
Just to see you
And I know you cannot wait
Wait to see me too
I've got to touch you
Cause baby we'll be

At the drive in
In the old man's Ford
Behind the bushes
Til I'm screamin' for more
Down in the basement
Lock the cellar door
And baby
Talk dirty to me!

You know I call you, I call you on the telephone
I'm only hopin' that you're home
So I can hear you
When you say those words to me
And whisper so softly
I've gotta hear you
Cause baby we'll be

C.C. Pickup that guitar, and-a-talk to me, yeah

Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

Cause baby we'll be

At the drive in
In the old man's Ford
Behind them, bushes
Til I'm screamin' for more, more, more!
Down in the basement
And lock the cellar door
And baby, talk dirty to me, yeah
And baby, talk dirty to me yeah
And baby
Talk dirty to me

Uh!
Whoo!
That's the way I like it, baby
Ooh, yeah
