{And during the few moments that we have left
We want to talk, right down to Earth
In a language that everybody here can easily understand}

Look in my eyes, what do you see?
The cult of personality
I know your anger, I know your dreams
I've been everything you wanna be
I'm the cult of personality

Like Mussolini and Kennedy
I'm the cult of personality
The cult of personality
The cult of personality

Neon lights, nobel prize
When a mirror speaks, the reflection lies
You won't have to follow me
Only you can set me free

I sell the things you need to be
I'm the smiling face on your T V
I'm the cult of personality
I exploit you, still you love me
I tell you one and one makes three
I'm the cult of personality

Like Joseph Stalin and Gandhi
I'm the cult of personality
The cult of personality
The cult of personality

Neon lights, nobel prize
When a leader speaks that leader dies
You won't have to follow me
Only you can set you free

You gave me fortune, you gave me fame
You gave me power in your God's name
I'm every person you need to be
Oh, I'm the cult of personality
I am the cult of
I am the cult of
I am the cult of
I am the cult of
I am the cult of
I am the cult of
I am the cult of
I am the cult of personality
