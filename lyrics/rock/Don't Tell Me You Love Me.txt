It ain't the way you move
It ain't the way that you move me, oh no
It ain't the way you shake
It ain't the way that you shake me, oh no
I've been 25 years, I'm a kid on the run
I've got a pistol for action

Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me, I don't wanna know
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me, I don't wanna know

I love the way you use
I love the way that you use me, oh yeah
I love the way you shoot
I love the way that you shoot to kill me, oh yeah

It's taken miles and lines
To learn the right from the wrong
I'll keep you hangin' on

So don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me, I don't wanna know
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me, I don't wanna know

Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Love me, love me, love

Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me, I don't wanna know
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me, I don't wanna know
