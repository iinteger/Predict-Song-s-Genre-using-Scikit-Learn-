Well, swingin' on the front porch, on the lawn
Swingin' where we want 'cause there ain't nobody home
Swingin' to the left, swingin' to the right
I think about baseball, I'll [Incomprehensible] all night, yeah

Swingin' in the living room, in the kitchen
Most folks don't 'cause they're too busy bitchin'
Swingin' in there 'cause she wanted me to feed her
Mixed up the batter and she licked the beater

I scream, you scream, we all scream for her
Oh, don't even try, you can't ignore her

She's my cherry pie, cool drink of water, such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good, make a grown man cry
Sweet cherry pie, oh, yeah, she's my cherry pie
Put a smile on your face, ten miles wide
Looks so good, bring a tear to your eye, sweet cherry pie

Swingin' to the drums to guitar
Fucking with the bass in the back of my car
Ain't no money, got no gas
We're goin' if we swing real fast

I scream you, scream we, all scream for her
Don't even try, you can't ignore her

She's my cherry pie, cool drink of water, such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good make a grown man cry
Sweet cherry pie, oh, yeah, she's my cherry pie
Put a smile on your face, ten miles wide
Looks so good, bring a tear to your eye, sweet cherry pie, pie, yeah

Swingin' in the bathroom
Oh, swingin' in the bathroom, yeah, yeah

Swingin' in the bathroom, swingin' on the floor
She motherfuckin' hard, we forgot to lock the door
In walks her daddy, standin' six foot four
Ain't gonna swing with my daughter, no more

She's my cherry pie, cool drink of water, such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good, grown man cry
Sweet cherry pie, she's my cherry pie
Smile on your face, ten miles wide
Looks so good, bring a tear to your eye, sweet cherry pie
Sweet cherry pie
