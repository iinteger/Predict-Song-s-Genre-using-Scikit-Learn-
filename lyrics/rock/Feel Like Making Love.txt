Baby, when I think about you, I think about love
Darlin', don't live without you and your love
If I had those golden dreams of my yesterdays
I would wrap you in the Heaven 'til I'm dyin' on the way

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

Baby, if I think about you, I think about love
Darlin' if I live without you, I live without love
And if I had the sun and moon, we will shine them
I would give you both night and day of satisfyn'

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

And if I had those golden dreams of my yesterdays
I would wrap you in the Heaven 'til I'm dyin' on the way

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

Well I feel like makin' love
Well I feel like makin' love
Well I feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

Well I feel like makin' love
Well I feel like makin' love
Well I feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

Well I feel like makin' love
Well I feel like makin' love
