One foot on the brake and one on the gas, hey
Well, there's too much traffic, I can't pass, no
So I tried my best illegal move
Well, baby, black and white come and touched my groove again

Gonna write me up a 125
Post my face wanted dead or alive
Take my license, all that jive
I can't drive 55, oh no

So I signed my name on number 24, hey
Yeah, the judge said, "Boy, just one more
We're gonna throw your ass in the city joint"
Looked me in the eye, said, "You get my point?"
I said, "Yeah, oh yeah"

Write me up a 125
Post my face wanted dead or alive
Take my license, all that jive
I can't drive 55, oh, yeah

I can't drive 55
I can't drive 55
I can't drive 55
I can't drive 55

When I drive that slow, you know it's hard to steer
And I can't get get my care out of second gear
What used to take two hours now takes all day
It took me 16 hours to get to L.A.

Gonna write me up a 125
Post my face wanted dead or alive
Take my license, all that jive
I can't drive 55, no, no, no

I can't drive
(I can't drive 55)
I can't drive
(I can't drive 55)
I can't drive 55
