Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean
Gotta get away
Holy Diver
Shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you
Look out
Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
Oh we will pray it's all right
Gotta get away, get away
Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel
The vision never dies
Life's a never ending wheel
Holy Diver
You're the star of the masquerade
No need to look so afraid
Jump, jump
Jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen, yeah
Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me
No, no
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean
Gotta get away, get away
Gotta get away, get away
Holy diver, soul survivor
You' re the one whose clean
Holy Diver, Holy Diver
Never come to knew, coming after you
Holy Diver
Holy Diver, yeah
Alright, get away, get away, get away
Holy diver
Holy diver
