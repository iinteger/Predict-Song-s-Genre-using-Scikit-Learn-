Aey oh, let's go
Aey oh, let's go
Aey oh, let's go
Aey oh, let's go

They're formin' in a straight line
They're goin' through a tight one
The kids are losin' their minds
The Blitzkrieg bop
They're pilin' in the back seat
They generate steam heat
Pulsatin' to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg bop

Aey oh, let's go
Shoot 'em in the back now
What they want? I don't know
They're all reaved up and ready to go

They're formin' in a straight line
They're goin' through a tight one
The kids are losin' their minds
The Blitzkrieg bop
They're pilin' in the back seat
They generate steam heat
Pulsatin' to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg bop

Aey oh, let's go
Shoot 'em in the back now
What they want? I don't know
They're all reaved up and ready to go

They're formin' in a straight line
They're goin' through a tight one
The kids are losin' their minds
The Blitzkrieg bop
They're pilin' in the back seat
They generate steam heat
Pulsatin' to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg bop

Aey oh, let's go
Aey oh, let's go
Aey oh, let's go
Aey oh, let's go
