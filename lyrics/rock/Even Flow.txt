Freezin', rests his head on a pillow made of concrete, again
Oh, feelin', maybe he'll see a little better set a days
Oh, hand out faces that he sees time again, ain't that familiar
Oh, dark grin, he can't help when he's happy, looks insane, yeah

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away, yeah
Oh, someday yet, he'll begin his life again
Life again, life again

Kneeling, looking through the paper though he doesn't know to read
Oh, praying, now to something that has never showed him anything
Oh, feeling understands the weather of the winters on its way
Oh, ceilings, few and far between all the legal halls of shame, yeah

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Oh, someday yet, he'll begin his life again
Oh, whispering hands gently lead him away
Him away, him away, yeah

Oh, even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away, yeah
Someday yet, he'll begin his life again, maybe in the next life
Whispering hands gently lead him away
Him away, him away, yeah
