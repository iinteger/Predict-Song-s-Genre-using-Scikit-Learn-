I wanna be somebody

You say you don't wanna run an' hide
A face that no one knows
An' everyone you meet, you're gonna show

You're nobody's slave
Nobody's chains are holdin' you
You hold your fist up high an' rule the zoo

Oh, you've just go to be
Up high where the whole world's watchin' me
'Cause I, I've got the guts to be somebody
You cry out

I wanna be somebody, be somebody soon
I wanna be somebody, be somebody too
I wanna be somebody, be somebody soon
I wanna be somebody, be somebody too
[Incomprehensible]

You don't wanna starve
Well, take the table crumbs that fall
You don't wanna beg or plead at all

You don't want no 9 to 5 job
Fingers to the bone
You don't want the rock piles' bloody stones

Oh, you've just got to be
Up high where the whole world's watchin' me
Oh, 'cause I, I've got the guts to be somebody
You cry out

I wanna be somebody, be somebody soon
I wanna be somebody, be somebody too
I wanna be somebody, be somebody soon
I wanna be somebody, be somebody too

You wanna be like me

I want shiny cars an' dirty money
Lotsa rock n' roll
I will live in fame an' die in flames
I'm never gettin' old

I wanna be somebody, be somebody too
Look out, look out

I'm gonna be somebody
I'm gonna be somebody
I'm gonna be somebody
I'm gonna be somebody
