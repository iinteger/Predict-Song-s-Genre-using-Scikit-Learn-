Last night a little dancer
came dancing to my door
Last night a little angel
came pumping on the floor
She said, come on baby
You got a license for love
And if it expires
pray help from above, because
in the midnight hour
she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell
she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour, babe
more, more, more
With a rebel yell
more, more, more, more, more, more
She don't like slavery
she won't sit and beg
But when I'm tired and lonely
she sees me to bed
What set you free
and brought you to me, babe
What set you free
I need you here by me
because
In the midnight hour
she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell
she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour, babe
more, more, more
With a rebel yell
more, more, more
He lives in his own Heaven
Collects it to go from the seven eleven
Well he's out all night to collect a fare
Just so long, just so long it don't mess up his hair
I walked the ward
for you, babe
A thousand miles
for you
I dried your tears
of pain, babe
A million times for you
I'd sell my soul
for you, babe
For money to burn
with you
I'd give you all
and have none, babe
Just to, just to, just to
just to have you here by me, because
In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell
she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour babe
more, more, more
With a rebel yellm she cried
more, more, more, more, more, more
Oh yeah, little baby
She wants more
more, more, more, more, more
Oh yeah, little angel
She wants more
more, more, more, more, more!
