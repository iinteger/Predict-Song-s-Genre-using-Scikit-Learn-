In my eyes, indisposed
In disguise as no one knows
Hides the face, lies the snake
The sun in my disgrace

Boiling heat, summer stench
'Neath the black, the sky looks dead
Call my name through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again

Black hole sun, won't you come?
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?

Stuttering, cold and damp
Steal the warm wind, tired friend
Times are gone for honest men
And sometimes far too long for snakes

In my shoes, a walking sleep
And my youth, I pray to keep
Heaven send Hell away
No one sings like you anymore

Hang my head, drown my fear
Till you all just disappear

Black hole sun, won't you come?
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?

Black hole sun, won't you come?
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?

Black hole sun, won't you come?
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?
