Ace Of Spades
"Ace of Spades"  by Motorhead

If you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your man
you win some, lose some, it's all the same to me
The pleasure is to play, it makes no difference what you say
I don't share your greed, the only card I need is
the Ace of Spades
the Ace of Spades

Playin' for the high one, dancin' with the devil
going with the flow, it's all a game to me
7 or 11, snake eyes watching you
Double up or quit, double stake or split

You know I'm born to lose
and gamblin's made for fools
But that's the way I like it baby
I don't want to live forever

and don't forget the joker

Pushing up the ante, I know you got to see me
read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again
I see it in your eyes, take one look and die
The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be
