Now everybody have you heard
If you're in the game, then the stroke's the word
Don't take no rhythm, don't take no style
Got a thirst for killin', grab your vile

You put your right hand out, give a firm hand-shake
Talk to me about that one big break
Spread your ear-pollution both far and wide
Keep your contributions by your side, stroke has struck me

Could be a winner, boy, you move quite well
Stroke has struck me, stroke has struck me
You got your number down, stroke has struck me
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now

You put your left foot out keep it all in place
Work your way right into my case
First you try to bed me you make my backbone slide
But when you found you bled me, skip on by, keep on
Stroke has struck me

Give me the business all night long
Stroke has struck me, stroke has struck me
You're so together boy, stroke has struck me
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now

Better listen now, it ain't no joke
(Said)
Let your conscience fail ya, just do the stroke
Don'tcha take no chances, keep your eye on top
Do your fancy dances, you can't stop you just
Stroke has struck me, stroke has struck me

Better listen now, it ain't no joke
(Said)
Let your conscience fail ya, just do the stroke
Don'tcha take no chances, keep your eye on top
Do your fancy dances, you can't stop you just
Stroke has struck me, stroke has struck me

Better listen now, it ain't no joke
(Said)
Let your conscience fail ya, just do the stroke
Don'tcha take no chances, keep your eye on top
Do your fancy dances, you can't stop you just
Stroke has struck me, stroke has struck me
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now
