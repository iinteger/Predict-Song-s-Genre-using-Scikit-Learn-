Baby baby baby.
Ee-ow...

So you think I got an evil mind, well I'll tell you honey
And I don't know why
And I don't know why

So you think my singing's out of time, well it makes me money
And I don't know why
And I don't know why anymore
Oh no

[Chorus]:
So cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We get wild, wild, wild,
We get wild, wild, wild,
So cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We get wild, wild, wild,
At your door

So you think I got a funny face, I ain't got no worries
And I don't know why
And I don't know why

So I'm a scruff bag well it's no disgrace, I ain't in no hurry
And I don't know why
I just don't know why anymore
Oh no

So you think we have a lazy time, well you should know better
And I don't know why
I just don't know why

And you say I got a dirty mind, well I'm a mean go getter
And I don't know why
And I don't know why anymore
Oh no

So cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We get wild, wild, wild,
We get wild, wild, wild...
