Say your prayers little one
Don't forget my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
'Til the sandman, he comes, yeah

Sleep with one eye open
Grippin' your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never, never land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of snow white
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragons fire
And of things that will bite, yeah

Sleep with one eye open
Grippin' your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never, never land

Now I lay me down to sleep
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep

If I die before I wake
If I die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take
Pray the lord my soul to take

Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never, never land

We're off to never, never land
  (Take my hand)
We're off to never, never land
  (Take my hand)
We're off to never, never land
