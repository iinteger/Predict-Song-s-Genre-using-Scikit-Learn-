Yeah, yeah, ah, yeah
I live my life like there's no tomorrow
And all I've got, I had to steal
Least I don't need to beg or borrow
Yes I'm livin' at a pace that kills

Ooh, yeah
  (Ahh)
Runnin' with the Devil
  (Ahh-hah, yeah)
  (Woo-hoo-oo)
Runnin' with the Devil
Yes I'm, yeah, hoo

Ooh, you know I
I found the simple life ain't so simple
When I jumped out, on that road
I got no love, no love you'd call real
Ain't got nobody, waitin' at home

(Ahh, yeah)
Runnin' with the Devil
  (Hold on, hold on I'm runnin' ah yeah)
Runnin' with the Devil
 (Ooh ooh, one more time)

  (Ha-yeah)
Runnin' with the Devil
  (Oh, yeah, ya-yeah)
Runnin' with the Devil
  (Woo, woo)
Runnin' with the Devil
  (I'll tell you about it)

I found the simple life, it's so simple
When I jumped out, on that road
I got no love, no love you'd call real
Ain't got nobody, waitin' at home

  (Ha-yeah)
Runnin' with the Devil
  (Oh, yeah)
Runnin' with the Devil
  (Ah-ha, yeah, ah-ha, yeah, ah-hah, yeah)
Runnin' with the Devil
