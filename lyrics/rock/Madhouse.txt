White coats to bind me, out of control
I live alone inside my mind
World of confusion, air filled with noise
Who says that my life's such a crime?

Trapped, in this nightmare I wish I'd wake
As my whole life begins to shake
Four walls, surround me an empty gaze
I can't find my way out of this maze

'Cause I don't care fall in, fall out
Gone without a doubt, help me
Can't take the blame
They don't feel the shame

It's a madhouse
Or so they claim
It's a madhouse
Am I insane?

My fears behind me, what can I do
My dreams haunt my sleep at night
Oh no, won't learn the lesson, white fills my eyes
And only then they see the light

Trapped, in this nightmare I wish I'd wake
As my whole life begins to shake
Four walls, surround me an empty gaze
I can't find my way out of this maze

'Cause I don't care fall in, fall out
Gone without a doubt, help me
Can't take the blame
They don't feel the shame

It's a madhouse
Or so they claim
It's a madhouse
Am I insane?

Trapped, in this nightmare I wish I'd wake
As my whole life begins to shake
Four walls, surround me an empty gaze
I can't find my way out of this maze

'Cause I don't care fall in, fall out
Gone without a doubt, help me
Can't take the blame
They don't feel the shame

It's a madhouse
Or so they claim
It's a madhouse
Am I insane?

Mad, madhouse, mad, mad, mad, madhouse
