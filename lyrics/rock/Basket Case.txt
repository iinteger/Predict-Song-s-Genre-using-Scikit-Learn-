Do you have the time?
To listen to me whine
About nothin' and
Everything all at once

I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone
No doubt about it

Sometimes I give
Myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind
Plays tricks on me

It all keeps addin' up
I think I'm crackin' up
And am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

Yea, I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex
That's bringin' me down

And I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So I quit my whinin'
'Cause it's bringin' her down

Sometimes I give
Myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind
Plays tricks on me

It all keeps addin' up
I think I'm crackin' up
And am I just paranoid?
Ah, yea, yea, yea

Go, go
Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes I give
Myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind
Plays tricks on me

It all keeps addin' up
And I think I'm crackin' up
And am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?
