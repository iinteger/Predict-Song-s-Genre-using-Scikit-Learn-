Can't explain all the feelings that you're making me feel.
My heart's in overdrive, and you're behind the steering wheel.

Touching you, touching me.
Touching you, God, you're touching me.

I believe in a thing called love.
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart.
There's a chance we could make it now.
We'll be rocking till the Sun goes down.
I believe in a thing called love.

I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day.
You got me in a spin, but everything is a, okay!

Touching you, touching me.
Touching you cause you're touching me.

I believe in a thing called love.
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart.
There's a chance we could make it now.
We'll be rocking till the Sun goes down.
I believe in a thing called love.

Touching you, touching me.
Touching you, God, you're touching me.

I believe in a thing called love.
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart.
There's a chance we could make it now.
We'll be rocking till the Sun goes down.
I believe in a thing called love.
