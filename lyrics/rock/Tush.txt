I been up, I been down
Take my word, my way around
I ain't askin' for much
I said, Lord, take me downtown
I'm just lookin' for some tush

I been bad, I been good
Dallas, Texas, Hollywood
I ain't askin' for much
I said, Lord, take me downtown
I'm just lookin' for some tush

Take me back, way back home
Not by myself, not alone
I ain't askin' for much
I said, Lord, take me downtown
I'm just lookin' for some tush
