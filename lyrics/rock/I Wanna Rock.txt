Turn it down you say
Well, all I got to say to you is
Time and time again I say, "No"
No, no, no, no, no, no

Tell me not to play
Well, all I got to say to you
When you tell me not to play, I say, "No"
No, no, no, no, no, no

So, if you ask me why I like the way I play it
There's only one thing I can say to you

There's a feelin' that I get from nothin' else
And there ain't nothin' in the world
That makes me go
Go, go, go, go, go, go

Turn the power up
I've waited for so long
So I could hear my favorite song so let's go
Go, go, go, go, go, go

When it's like this, I feel the music shootin' through me
There's nothin' else that I would rather do
