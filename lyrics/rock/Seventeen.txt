I saw sparks fly from the corner of my eye
And when I turned it was love at first sight
I said,"Please excuse me, I didn't catch you name
It'd be a shame not to see you again"

And just when I thought
She was comin' to my door
She whispered sweet
And brought me to the floor

She said, "I'm only seventeen
I'll show you love like you've never seen"
She's only seventeen
Daddy says she's too young
But she's old enough for me

Come to my place, we can talk it over
Everythin' goin' down in your head
She said take it easy, I need some time
Time to work it out, to make you mine

And just when I thought
She was coming to my door
She whispered sweet
And brought me to the floor

She said,"I'm only seventeen
You ain't seen love
Ain't seen nothin' like me"
She's only seventeen, seventeen

Such a bad girl, loves to work me over time
Feels good dancin' close to the borderline
She's a magic mountain, she's a leather glove
She's my soul, it must be love

She's only seventeen
The girl she gives me love
Like I've never seen
She's only seventeen
Daddy says she's too young
But she's old enough for me

She's everythin' I need
Daddy says, she's too young
But she's old enough
Old enough for me, yeah yeah
