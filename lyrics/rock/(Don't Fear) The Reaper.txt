All our times have come
Here but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain
We can be like they are

Come on, baby, don't fear the reaper
Baby take my hand, don't fear the reaper
We'll be able to fly, don't fear the reaper
Baby, I'm your man

La la la la la
La la la la la

Valentine is done
Here but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity
Romeo and Juliet

40,000 men and women everyday
Like Romeo and Juliet
40,000 men and women everyday
Redefine happiness
Another 40,000 coming everyday
We can be like they are

Come on, baby, don't fear the reaper
Baby, take my hand, don't fear the reaper
We'll be able to fly, don't fear the reaper
Baby, I'm your man

La la la la la
La la la la la

Love of two is one
Here but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear she couldn't go on
Then the door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew and then disappeared
The curtains flew and then he appeared, saying don't be afraid

Come on, baby and she had no fear
And she ran to him, then they started to fly
They looked backward and said goodbye
She had become like they are
She had taken his hand, she had become like they are
Come on, baby, don't fear the reaper
