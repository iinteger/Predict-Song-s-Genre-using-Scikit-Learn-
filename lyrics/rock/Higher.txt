When dreaming I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake

So let's go there, let's make our escape
Come on let's go there, let's ask, â€½Can we stay?â€

Can you take me higher?
To the place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To the place with golden streets

Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate those nights and those dreams
But my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate

So let's go there, let's make our escape
Come on let's go there, let's ask, â€½Can we stay?â€

Can you take me higher?
To the place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To the place with golden streets

So let's go there, let's go there
Come on let's go there, let's ask, â€½Can we stay?â€

Up high I feel like I'm
Alive for the very first time
Set up high I'm strong enough
To take these dreams and make them mine

Set up high I'm strong enough
To take these dreams and make them mine

Can you take me higher?
To the place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To the place with golden streets

Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To the place with golden streets
