Backstroker, lover always hidin' 'neath the covers
'Till you talked to my daddy he say
He said you ain't seen nothin' 'till you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a changin' your way

I met a cheerleader was a real young bleeder
Oh the times I could reminisce
Oh the best thing a lover wit her sister and her cousin
Started with a little kiss, like this

Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
With your feet flyin' up in the air
Singin' hey diddle diddle
With your kitty in the middle of the swing like I didn't care

So I took a big chance at the high school dance
Missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin' she knew what she was doin'
Told me how to walk this way, told me to

Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
She told me to
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way

Well just gimme a
Like this

Schoolgirl sweetie with a classy little sassy
Got her skirt climbin' way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at moi

Was a high school loser never made it with a lady
'Till the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then a next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
I gave her just a little kiss, like this

Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
With your feet flyin' up in the air
Singin' hey diddle diddy aa diddle diddle
Like you didn't care

So I took a big chance at the high school dance
Missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin' she knew what she was doin'
Told me how to walk this way, told me to

Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way

Just gimme a kiss
Like this
