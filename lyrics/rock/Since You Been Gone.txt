I get the same old dreams same time every night
Fall to the ground and I wake up
So I get out of bed, put on my shoes and in my head
Thoughts fly back to the breakup

These four wall are closing in
Look at the fix you put me in

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head can't take it
Could I be wrong but since you been gone
You cast your spell so break it
Since you been gone

So in the night I stand beneath the backstreet light
I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon, the night time comes around too soon
You can't know what you mean to me

Your poison letter, your telegram
Just goes to show you don't give a damn

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head can't take it
Could I be wrong but since you been gone
You cast your spell so break it
Since you been gone

If you will come back
Baby, you know you'll never do wrong

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head can't take it
Could I be wrong but since you been gone
You cast your spell so break it
Ever since you been gone

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head can't take it
Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head can't take it
