{Oh, wow, man, I said
Wait a second, man
What do you think the teacher's gonna look like this year?
Fuck man!}

Oh yeah, t-t-teacher stop that screamin'
Teacher don't you see? Don't wanna be no uptown fool
Maybe I should go to hell but I am doing well
Teacher needs to see me after school

I think of all the education that I've missed
But then my homework was never quite like this

Ow! Got it bad, got it bad, got it bad
I'm hot for teacher
I've got it bad, so bad
I'm hot for teacher

{Hey, I heard you missed us, we're back!
I brought my pencil
Give me something to write on, man
Whoa}

I heard about your lessons but lessons are so cold
I didn't know about this school
Little girl from Cherry Lawn, how can you be so bold?
How did you know that golden rule?

I think of all the education that I've missed
But then my homework was never quite like this

Whoa! Got it bad, got it bad, got it bad
I'm hot for teacher
I've got it bad, so bad
I'm hot for teacher, woh

{Oh man, I think the clock is slow
What are you doin' this weekend?
I don't feel tardy
Class dismissed}

Ooh, yeah
I've got it bad, got it bad, got it bad
I'm hot for teacher

Whoa
Oh! Yes I'm hot
Oh my God!
Whoo!
