So, this ain't end I saw you again today
I had to turn my heart away
You smiled like the sun, kisses for everyone
And tails, they never fail

You're lying so low in the weeds

I bet you're gonna ambush me

You'd have me down, down, down on my knees

Now would ya, Barracuda?

Back over time
When we were all
Trying for free
You met the porpoise and me

No right, No wrong
You're selling a song
A name, whisper game

If the real thing don't do the trick
You'd better make up something quick
You're gonna burn, burn, burn it to the wick
Ooh, Barracuda!

Oohhhh Yaaaa

" Sell me, Sell you" the porpoise said

Dive down, deep down
To save my head
You, I think that you had the blues too

All that night and all the next
Swam without looking back
Made for the western pools
Silly silly fools

(Instrumental)

If the real thing don't do the trick
You'd better think up something quick
You're gonna burn, burn, burn it to the wick
Oooohhhh, Barra Barracuda

Instrumental til end
