Ricky was a young boy, he had a heart of stone
Lived 9 to 5 and he worked his fingers to the bone
Just barely get out of school, came from the edge of town
Fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down, oh no

He had no money, no, no good at home
He walked the streets as soldier and he fought the world alone

And now it's 18 and life, you got it, 18 and life, you know
Your crime is time and it's 18 and life to go
18 and life, you got it, 18 and life, you know
Your crime is time and it's 18 and life to go

Tequila in his heartbeat, his veins burned gasoline
He kept his motor running, but it never kept him clean
They say he loved adventure, "Ricky's the wild one"
He married trouble and had a courtship with a gun

Bang bang shoot 'em up, the party never ends
You can't think of dying when the bottle's your best friend

And now it's 18 and life, you got it, 18 and life, you know
Your crime is time and it's 18 and life to go
18 and life, you got it, 18 and life, you know
Your crime is time and it's 18 and life to go, yeah

"Accidents will happen", they all heard Ricky say
He fired his six-shot to the wind, that child blew a child away

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
18 and life, you got it, 18 and life, you know
Your crime is time and it's 18 and life to go
18 and life, you got it, 18 and life, you know
Your crime is time and it's 18 and life to go
