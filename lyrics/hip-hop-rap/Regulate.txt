Regulators, we regulate any stealing of his property
And we damn good too but you can't be any geek off the street
Gotta be handy with the steel if you know what I mean
Earn your keep, regulators, mount up

It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

So I hooks a left on the 21 and Lewis
Some brothas shootin' dice so I said, "Let's do this"
I jumped out the ride, and said, "What's up?"
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said, "I'm stuck"

Since these girls peepin' me, I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Won'tcha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brotha said, "Damn, what's next?"

They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They got guns to my head, I think, I'm going down
I can't believe this happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I could fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

I laid all them busters down, I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

Now Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked, I was on the same track
Back up back up 'cause it's on
N A T E and me, the Warren to the G

Just like I thought, they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help the Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else one of them dames was sexy as hell
I said "Ooo I like your size"

She said, "My car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would ya let me ride?"
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-Funk, step to this, I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble

Chords, strings
We brings melody
G-Funk, where rhythm is life
And life is rhythm

If you know like I know
You don't wanna step to this
It's the G-Funk era
Funked out with a gangsta twist

If you smoke like I smoke
Then you high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster
213 will regulate
