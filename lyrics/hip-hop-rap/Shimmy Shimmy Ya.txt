Oh, fuck, you can't even sing

Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah baby, I like it raw

Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge, Bon Voyage
Yeah, from the home of the dodgers, Brooklyn squad

Wu-Tang killer bees on a swarm
Rain on ya dollar's ass, disco dorm
For you to even touch my skill
You gotta have the one killer bee and he ain't gonna kill now

Chop that down, pass it all around
Lyrics get hard, quick cement to the ground
For any MC in any 52 states
I gets psycho killer Norman Bates

My producer slam, my flow is like bam
Jump on stage, and then I dun-daah

I like the way you come

Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah baby, I like it raw

Hey, baby, I like it raw
Yeah baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah baby, I like it raw

Shi-shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge, Bon Voyage
Yeah, from the home of the dodgers, Brooklyn squad

Wu-Tang killer bees on a swarm
Rain on ya dollar's ass, disco dorm
For you to even touch my skill
You gotta have the one killer bee and he ain't gonna kill now

Chop that down, pass it all around
Lyrics get hard, quick cement to the ground
For any MC in any 52 states
I gets psycho killer Norman Bates

My producer slam, sharp like bam
Jump on stage, and then I dun-daah

Shi-shimmy shimmy ya, yeah
Shi-shi-shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Shi-shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Shi-shi-shimmy shi-shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Shi-shimmy shi-shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Shimmy shimmy ya
