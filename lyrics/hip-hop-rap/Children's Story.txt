Uncle Ricky, could you read us a bedtime story?
Please, huh, please?
Alright, you kids get to bed, I'll get the storybook
Y'all tucked in? Yeah, here we go

Once upon a time, not long ago
Where people wore pajamas and lived life slow
Where laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin' like they ought to good

There lived a little boy who was misled
By another little boy and this is what he said
Me and you Tike, we're gonna make some cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' the dash

They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sister and a brother
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover

The cop grabbed his arm, he started actin' erratic
He said, "Keep still boy, no need for static"
Punched him in his belly and gave him a slap
But little did he know, the little boy was strapped

The kid pulled outta gun, he said, "Why'd you hit me?"
The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
I'll do years if I pull this trigger

So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radios in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw the sister
Shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her

Looked 'round good and from expectations
He decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming and he made a left
He was running top speed till he was out of breath

Knocked and old man down and swore he killed him
Then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up a door, there guess who he saw

Dave, the dope fiend shootin' dope
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap?
He said, "I need bullets, hurry up, run"
The dope fiend rolled back a spankin' shot gun

He went outside but there were cops all over
Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doin' 83
Crashed into a tree, near university

Escaped alive, though the car was battered
Rat-a-tat-tatered and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets and he still had static
Grabbed the pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic

Point it at her head, he said the gun was full of lead
He told the cops, "Back off or honey here's dead"
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on

Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
And before long the boy got surrounded
He dropped his gun so went the glory
And this is the way I have to end this story

He was only one teen in a madman's dream
The cops shot the kid, I still here him scream
This ain't funny, so don't ya dare laugh
Just another case about the wrong path
Straight and narrow or your soul gets cast
Goodnight
