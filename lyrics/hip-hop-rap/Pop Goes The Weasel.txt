Let's all sing, pop goes the weasel

Pop goes the, pop goes the windin' of the weasel
I see the empty pocket needs a refill
I got a squad with a list of complainers
I should have started rape, rappers against phony entertainers
So we can make it known that we won't get swayed
It's ninety-one son, so somethin's gotta change

Gettin' paid to peddle sneakers and soda pop
(Pop pop pop)
Pop goes the weasel as drawers drop
(Drop drop drop)
Why not take your top ten pop hit
Fix the music and make senseless rhymes fit?

I guess it's the fact that you can't be artistic
Intricate raps, becomin' so simplistic
I gotta strong mind, it doesn't have to be spoon-fed
And I can read what doesn't have to be read
So some stay illiterate and feeble, legally licked
You go the ways of the weasel
(The weasel)

Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
(Pop goes the weasel 'cuz the weasel goes pop)

Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
(Pop goes the weasel 'cuz the weasel goes pop)

Hip-hop, got turned into hit pop
The second a record was number one on the pop charts
For those that get on heart that got a spot in the ghetto
Let no one forget about the hard part

Now in ninety-one we got a new brand, a new band
Lookin' like the same old Klan
Same old thieves that skeez so we gotta make sure
That real rap has got to endure

Why score all my points in one period?
Appearin' in complex structure like a pyramid
The paper for the media presence
Ya learn lesson from the face of false legend

Stop vexin' on the skills, ya ain't originate
The thin ice you skate upon will break and set ya straight
Ate up on the plate, now who's diesel?
Not the weasel, not the weasel, pop goes the weasel

Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
(Pop goes the weasel 'cuz the weasel goes pop)

Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
(Pop goes the weasel 'cuz the weasel goes pop)

Ya stole somebody's record then ya looped it, ya looped it
Ya boosted the record then ya looped it, ya looped it
Aiyyo, I came from Cali, and they hooped it, they hooped it
But now you're getting sued, kinda stupid

Boosted tracks get slaps, ya got no haps
To reach all four corners of the map
For kids in Kansas to those who speak Spanish
Doin' crazy damage so the wack gets banished
Can't manage the truth until you buy a way

Ya ain't quick so ya switch off the exit from my highway
To rest but a crook, had to take a second look
Ever heard of a chef who can't cook?
But the minister prime can lay laws
Hey yo, Pete Nice, rip the mic and go for yours

Goes for mine, I goes for mine
Find the prime won't eat the green eggs and swine
On line like the search in the hoody with the woody
Get a disc or tape at Sam Goody
Why'd ya run through the doors some left open?

Ropin' off the scenes of the crime smokin'
I got pub and I'ma nut like a scud see
Blowin' up like I'm throwin' up a beef patty
Sell-outs run 'bout like the measles
No cures 'cause pop goes the weasels

Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
(Pop goes the weasel 'cuz the weasel goes pop)

Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
(Pop goes the weasel 'cuz the weasel goes pop)

Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
(Pop goes the weasel 'cuz the weasel goes pop)

Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
(Pop goes the weasel 'cuz the weasel goes pop)
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel
