Intro: Lil' Kim

See I believe in money, power and respect
First you the money
Then you get the motherf--kin' power
And after you get the f--kin' power
You get the f--kin' ni--az to respect you

chorus (Lil' Kim)

It's the key to life
Money power respect
That you need in life
Money power respect
You'll be eatin' right
Money power respect
You can sleep at night
You'll see the light
It's the key to life
Money power respect
That you need in life
Money power respect
You'll be eatin' right
Money power respect
Money power respect
Money power respect

Verse One: Sheek

Aye yo my whole click bout it bout it
We take yours while you pout about it
Truck, step out the Horace wanna crowd around it
You can see me on Optimum TV, or in the bathroom
Turn the light out, scream!
Bloody Mary, one two three
Sheek ain't ya usual friend, but I can set you up like Kaiser
Walk straight up the end, I'm done with ice and charms
I'm tryin' to ice my whole caskit when I'm gone
Pull up with class on the Don, once I meet 'em I greet 'em
Kiss his feet for freedom, tell him thank you Lord
Cause on Earth I was getttin' bored
Now resurect me back to this cat called Sheek
So I can make this album get back the cats that's weak
230, 6'2", need funds from you that's like a cat versus a pitbull
Gun, no flip for, keep hunger
And plan for the future cause you figure you gon' be older
When way longer then ya gon' be younger

chorus (Lil' Kim)

Verse Two: Styles

(clock tickin') Only time can tell how the clock tick
I really love here but I'm still a hostage
Two personallities, check the posture
Smoke out the mouth, clear out the nostrals
Thinkin' death, the life seems scarey
I'm passin' graveyards, seeing people Hail Mary
I ain't chillin', till I'm out
Parash you and race my man in mild climate
Called out ten diamonds, twenty five thousand a peice
F--k streets, tryin' to own the island forget about woulin'
Tri ridin', in the car that be glidin'
If I should you were I lived you would think I was hottest
Sling dick to the chicks who that don't speak English
Wake up to Trinidad, like f---in' I'm rich
Come back, probably jet, live on set
If you can sh-t go out and spit bragoits

chorus (Lil' Kim overlaps last line)

Verse Three: Jadakiss

Yo yo yo yo yo nuttin' but the hotness, whenever we drop this
Monotnis, for ya'll to keep hatin'
Cause ya'll never gon' stop us, I keep my rocks spotless
And my ho-s topless, take time try to figure out who The Lox is?
Spare no one, keep rhymes like Shogun
You scared to blow one, get robbed with your own guns
If I don't respect you I'ma check you
And if I don't kiss you I'm gon' peck you
Right before I wet you, I sneeze on tracks and bless you
I'm special, and if you like workin' out then I'm gon' strech you
Hustilin' is dead but we still get red, turn the spots in the bakery
To give back bread, and ya'll said my money spent
But it's in the bed, so when the feds come the dogs can't get a scent
And my story, self explainitory
That I'm the hotess thing on the streets
And ya'll ain't got nothing for me

chorus (Lil' Kim)

Verse Four: DMX

(arff! arff!) This is the beat that I can freak it
Just drop the reals, plus the ni--a with the ill
Ya'll ni--az know my skills, ask from the grills
Get 'em up, spit 'em up
Red 'em up, then watch them come
Get 'em up, set 'em up
Rather do dirt then get dirt, b--ch I make ya sh-t hurt
Then step back, like I did work
This ain't no fu--in' game, what'cha think I'm playin'
Till you layin', so where the junkyard decayin'
Moms at home prayin', till you comin' home but you not
Just sittin' up in the trunk startin' to rot
And Hell is hot, only cause I'm here now baby
It's goin' down baby, peep the four pound baby
And let off up in a n--a, specially if he think he bigga
Then my motherfuckin' trigga, did I?
Can I get mine, is it gone
DMX representin' one time it's on
