Crush On You (Remix)
Intro: Lil' Cease

Undeas (uhh... uh-huh)
Lil' Ceaser (uhh... uh-hah, Queen Bee)
Uhh (uh-huh, that's me)
Uhh, check it (Lil' Kim)

Verse One: Lil' Cease

Yo I be buyin em V's, so all my girls be eyein Cease
Comin backstage, dyin to get pleased
You got me, I rock thee, Versace and linen
While you stop your grinnin wit bunch of foxy women
Why you speed ball with cards, that's invalid
I get clothes, custom made, from a stylist
Cruise in my Lexus Land with no mileage
While you walk the street until your feet get calloused
Take you on a natural high, like a pilot
It be all good, toss your clothes like a salad
When it's all over put your vote in my ballot
It's my diner, I'm Mel, and you're Alice
Spend a night, in Lil' Cease palace
It be all good as long as you don't act childish
While you standin there with the Crist' in your cup
If worse come to worse keep this on the hush, uhh

        Hook: Notorious B.I.G.

I know you seen me on the video (true)
I know you heard me on the radio (true)
But you still don't pay me no attention
Listenin to what your girlfriends mention
He's a slut, he's a hoe, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
It's cool, not tryin to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you

Verse Two: Lil' Kim

Aiyyo shorty, won't you go get a bag of the lethal
I'll be undressed in the bra all see through
While you count your jewels thinkin I'ma cheat you
The only one thing I wanna do is freak you
Keep your stone sets, I got my own baguettes
And I'll be doin things that you won't regret
Lil Kim the Queen Bee, so you best take heed
Shall I proceed?  (Yes indeed!)
I'ma throw shade, if I can't get paid
Blow you up to your girl like the Army grenade
You can slide on my ice like the Escapade
And itchy-gitchy-yaya with the marmalade
Who me?  Not you, oh yes, who's he?
I even dig yo' man's style, but I love yo' profile
Whisper in your ear and get you all shook up
But don't blush, just keep this on the hush

        Hook

Verse Three: Lil' Cease, Lil' Kim

While you tryin to catch Sea Breeze, I'm in the PV's
All chrome D3's, decked out TV's
CD's with crazy bass, keep my lady laced
Don't be fooled by the baby face
I hope ya not, cause your thighs got me hot
Only one plan, that's to rise to the top
I told you before, when I first pursued
I want a interlude, in the nude

You know I love the way you feel-a, sip my tequil-a
Works from the dealers, all in chinchila
Heat up the clutch, seven-fifty deluxe
Then we speed down the hutch, breakin trees in the dutch
I'm not the one you sleep wit, to eat quick
Want a cheap trick?  Better go down to FreakNik
You got to hit me off, buy this girl gifts of course
So I look slick, in my six, with my Christian LaCroix

        Hook (repeat 4X to fade)
