It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life

From standin' on the corners boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke glock

Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all know me to fail? Uh huh

Where all my brothers with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me mom I rub on your tits, and what not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot

Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty, uh huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh huh
And sip the cris' and get pissy pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my homie biggie, baby

You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter
Y'all volume 2, sing

It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life
