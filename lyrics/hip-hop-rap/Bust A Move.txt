This here’s a jam for all the fellas
Tryin’ to do what those ladies tell us.
Get shot down ’cause you’re overzealous,
Play hard to get, females get jealous.
OK smarty, go to a party,
Girls are scantily clad and showin’ body.
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her,
But you’re standin’ on the wall like you was Poindexter.

Next day’s function, high class luncheon,
Food is served and you’re stone cold munchin’.
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants.
A girl starts walkin’, guys start gawkin’,
Sits down next to you and starts talkin’.
Says she wanna dance ’cause she likes the groove,
So come on, fatso, and just bust a move.

(vocal scatting)
Just bust a move!

You’re on a mission and you’re wishin’
Someone could cure your lonely condition.
Lookin’ for love in all the wrong places,
No fine girls, just ugly faces.
From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation.
But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope,
So don’t hang yourself with a celibate rope.

New movie’s showin’, so you’re goin’
Could care less about the five you’re blowin’
Theatre gets dark just to start the show
Then you spot a fine woman sittin’ in your row
She’s dressed in yellow, she says “Hello,
Come sit next to me, you fine fellow!”
You run over there without a second to lose,
And what comes next? Hey, bust a move!

If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move!)
If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it.

In the city, ladies look pretty.
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty.
Tell a funny joke just to get some play,
Then you try to make a move and she says, “no way.”
Girls are fakin’, goodness sakin’,
They want a man who brings home the bacon.
Got no money and you got no car,
Then you got no woman and there you are.

Some girls are sophistic, materialistic,
Looking for a man makes them opportunistic.
They’re lyin’ on the beach perpetratin’ a tan
So that a brother with money can be their man.
So on the beach you’re strollin’, real high-rollin’,
Everything you have is yours and not stolen.
A girl runs up with somethin’ to prove,
So don’t just stand there, bust a move!

If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move)
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Break it down for me fellas)

Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry,
In five days from now he’s gonna marry.
He’s hopin’ you can make it there if you can,
‘Cause in the ceremony you’ll be the best man.
You say neato, check your libido,
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo.
The bride walks down just to start the wedding,
And there’s one more girl you won’t be getting.
So you start thinkin’, then you start blinkin’.
A bride maid looks and thinks that you’re winkin’.
She thinks you’re kinda cute so she winks back,
And now you’re feelin really fine ’cause the girl is stacked.
Reception’s jumpin’, bass is pumpin’,
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin’.
Says she wants to dance to a different groove.
Now you know what to do, G, bust a move!

If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move)
If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Move it, boy)
