We got the Refugees All Stars rubba dubbing in the club
Wyclef Jean, John Forte, Prizewell
Nah, mean the streets are getting a little crazy

Looka, looka, looka, looka, looka
Looka, looka, looka, here, looka, shorty, got back
Should I ask her for a dance
Hold on there's too many in a wolf pack

And besides Dirtycash talking to her
Buying her fake furs and taking her to the fever
Quite as his kept, that ain't even his Benz
She spends his Franklins at the malls with her friends

'Material Girl', living in a material world
But it's alright 'cause it's Saturday night
So Mista Funkmaster, pump the Bee Gees
And all you college students, bring your ouijas
Check the spelling R E F U G E E
Get the CD from Sam Goody, he he

You ain't even close wit the rhymes that you wrote
Don't be mad 'cause you broke
Let me clear my throat
John Forte, grab the mic, roots, sway it this way

I more than just a rhymer, you still a small timer
Hoping that the game treat that ass a little kinda
Every step tango'd, your beat don't concern me
I'm eating mangoes in Trinidad wit attorneys
(Oh, yeah)

My crews slang flow worldwide like a current
Wit da every spot where nobody get insurance
Brotha do the math, you ain't half near exotic
My man's claim true, you? Forget about it

Pope hoe just a new stance like my influence
Well, recognize, you a lie, trying do it
Got juice, told your lady oops, we nuts, baby
Smooth and charismatic, automatic, you gonna save me
God bless the day that my sons survive
We strive to teach the youth, baby and stay alive

Refugee camp, nuts baby
John Forte, yo, watch your lady
Yo, watch your lady
Special ill rhyme, Dirtycash
Yo, if you got more than dollar
In your pocket right now put your hands up

Yo, yo, you can tell by the way I roll shorty
That I'm a ladies man, a business man
Condos down the shore, multi million pension plans
But it ain't in my plan to make move without the fam

I keep it intact, you, 'Clef do the track
John play da mack while I pay the tax
Business as Usual watching Suspects
Steal my assets, get cut with Gillette's
We built this concept, connect like Nynex
Drinks at the bar, my American Express

Yo, I cook up, cook up, the cop a pull up, pull up
Then I cuff up, cuff up, you who's calling bluff?
Now you shook up, shook up 'cause you lock up, lock up
When I love up, love up, you, who's calling bluff?

Hey, yo, John is chilling, Dirtycash chilling
What more can I say? We living
That's what we got, we got it good
And since you understood we be

Yeah, live at the Carnival, '97 'til infinite
Refugee All Stars
Can't stop the shining, can't stop the shining
Can't stop the shining, can't stop the shining
You wanna stop the shining, you wanna stop the shining?
You wanna stop the shining, you wanna stop the shining?
Can't stop the shining, can't stop the shining
