Yo Rakim, what's up?
Yo, I'm doing the knowledge, E., man I'm trying to get paid in full
Well, check this out, since Norby Walters is our agency, right?
True

Kara Lewis is our agent, word up
Zakia and 4th and Broadway is our record company, indeed
Okay, so who we rollin' with then? We rollin' with Rush
Of Rushtown Management

Check this out, since we talking over
This def beat right here that I put together
I wanna hear some of them def rhymes, you know what I'm sayin'?
And together, we can get paid in full

Thinkin' of a master plan
'Cuz ain't nuthin' but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper but still comin' up with lint

So I start my mission, leave my residence
Thinkin' how could I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did

I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuthin' funny
Stop smiling, be still, don't nuthin' move but the money
But now I learned to earn 'cuz I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just

Search for a nine to five, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street whistlin' this
Feelin' out of place 'cuz, man, do I miss

A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric B, and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money it's still a wish

'Cuz I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
So now to test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio, 'cuz I'm paid in full

Rakim, check this out, yo
You go to your girl house and I'll go to mine
'Cause my girl is definitely mad
'Cause it took us too long to do this album

Yo, I hear what you're saying
So let's just pump the music up
And count our money

Yo, well check this out, yo Eli
Turn down the bass down
And let the beat just keep on rockin'

And we outta here
Yo, what happened to peace?
Peace
