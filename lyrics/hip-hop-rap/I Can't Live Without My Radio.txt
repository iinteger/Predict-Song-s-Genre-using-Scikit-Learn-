My radio, believe me, I like it loud
I'm the man with a box that can rock the crowd
Walkin' down the street, to the hardcore beat
While my JVC vibrates the concrete
I'm sorry if you can't understand
But I need a radio inside my hand
Don't mean to offend other citizens
But I kick my volume way past ten

My story is rough, my neighborhood is tough
But I still sport gold, and I'm out to crush
My name is Cool J, I devastate the show
But I couldn't survive without my radio
Terrorizing my neighbors with the heavy bass
I keep the suckas in fear by the look on my face

My radio's bad from the boulevard
I'm a Hip-Hop gangster and my name is Todd
Just stimulated by the beat, bust out the rhyme
Get fresh batteries if it won't rewind
'Cos I play everyday, even on the subway
I woulda got a summons but I ran away
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio

Suckas on my jock when I walk down the block
I really don't care if you're jealous or not
'Cos I make the songs, you sing along
And your radio's def when my record's on
So, get off the wall, become involved
All your radio problems have now been solved
My treacherous beats make ya ears respond
And my radio's loud like a fire alarm

The floor vibrates, the walls cave in
The bass makes my eardrums seem thin
Def sounds in my ride, yes the front and back
You would think it was a party, not a Cadillac
'Cos I drive up to the ave, with the windows closed
And my bass is so loud, it could rip your clothes

My stereo's thumpin' like a savage beast
The level on my power meter will not decrease
Suckas get mad, 'cos the girlies scream
And I'm still gettin' paid while you look at me mean
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
And I know I can't live without my radio

Don't touch that dial, I'll be upset
Might go into a fit and rip off your neck
'Cos the radio's thumpin' when I'm down to play
I'm the royal chief rocker LL Cool J
Let your big butt bounce from right to left
'Cos it's a actual fact this jam is Def
Most definitely created by me
Goin' down in radio history

I'm good to go on your radio
And I'm cold gettin' paid, 'cos Rick said so
Make the woofers wallop and your tweeters twitch
Some jealous knuckleheads might try to dis
But it's nuthin', ya frontin', ya girl I am stuntin'
And my radio's loud enough to keep you gruntin'

My name is Cool J, I'm from the rock
Circulating through your radio non-stop
I'm lookin' at the wires behind the cassette
And now I'm on the right, standing on the eject
Wearin' light blue pumas, a whole lotta gold
And jams like these keep me in control
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
And I know I can't live without my radio

Your energy level starts to increase
As my big beat is slowly released
I'm on the radio and at the jam
LL Cool J is who I am
I'mma make ya dance, boogie down and rock
And you'll scratch and shake to my musical plot
And to expand my musical plan
Cut creator, rock the beat with your hands

That's right, so don't try to front the move
As you become motivated by the funky groove
You can see me and earl chillin' on the block
With my box cold kickin' with the gangster rock
See people can't stop me, neither can the police
I'm a musical maniac to say the least
For you and your radio I made this for
Cool J's here to devastate once more
Pullin' all the girls, takin' out MC's

If ya try to disrespect me, I just say please
Here to command the hip-hop land
Kick it live with a box inside my hand
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio

Farmers boulevard, yeah
You know that's where me and E hang out, cool out
You know what I'm sayin'?
That's where the crib's at
