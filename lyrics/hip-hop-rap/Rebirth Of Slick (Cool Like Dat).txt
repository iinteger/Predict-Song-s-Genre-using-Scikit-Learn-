We like the breeze flow straight out of our lids
Them they got moved by these hard rock Brooklyn kids
Us flow a rush when the DJ's boomin' classics
You dig the crew on the fattest hip hop records

He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fatter joints called undergrounds
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms man boogie had to change

Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to un thought of dimensions
Why's it so fly 'cause hip hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light blue suede Pumas

What by the cut we push it off the corner
How was the buzz entire hip hop era?
Was fresh and fat since they started sayin' Audi
'Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie

The Puba of the styles like miles and shit
Like sixties funky worms with waves and perms
Just sendin' chunky rhythms right down ya block
We be to rap what key be to lock

But I'm cool like dat, I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat, I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat, I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat, I'm cool

We be the chocolates taps on my raps
She innovates at the sweeta cat naps
He at the funk club with the vibrate
Them they be crazy down with the five plate

It can kick a plan then a crowd burst
Me I be diggin' it with the bump verse
Us we be freakin' till dawn blinks an eye
He gives the strangest smile so I say hi

Who understood yeah understood the plan
Him heard a beat and put it to his hands
What I just flip let borders get loose
How to consume or they'll be just like juice

If it's the shit we'll lift it off the plastic
The babes'll go spastic hip hop gains a classic
Pimp playin' shock it don't matter I'm fatter
Ax Butta how I zone, man Cleopatra Jones

And I'm chill like dat, I'm chill like dat
I'm chill like dat, I'm chill like dat
I'm chill like dat, I'm chill like dat
I'm chill like dat, I'm chill

Blink, blink, blink
Think, think, think

We get ya free 'cause the clips be fat boss
Them they're the jams and commence to goin' off
She sweats the beat and ask me 'cause she puffed it
Me I got crew kids seven and a crescent

Us 'cause a buzz when the nickel bags are dealt
Him that's my man with the asteroid belt
They catch a fizz from the Mr. Doodle big
He rocks a tee from the Crooklyn non pigs

The rebirth of slick like my gangsta stroll
The lyrics just like loot come in stacks and rolls
You used to find a bug in a box with fade
Now he boogies up your stage plaits twist or braids

And I'm peace like dat, I'm peace like dat
I'm peace like dat, I'm peace like dat
I'm peace like dat, I'm peace like dat
I'm peace like dat, I'm peace

Check it out man I groove like dat
I'm smmoce like dat, I jive like dat, I roll like dat
Yeah I'm thick like dat, I stack like dat
I'm down like dat, I'm black like dat

Well yo I funk like dat, I'm fat like dat
I'm in like dat, 'cause I swing like dat
We jazz like dat, we freak like dat
We zoom like dat we out
