Yo Jinx man, we gotta find somebody that's down for hers, man
All these girls simple man, who you think fit the category?

It's me, the brand new intelligent black woman Y O Y O
Which is Yo-Yo but I'm not to be played
Like I was made by Matell
But this Yo-Yo is made by woman and male

I rhyme about uprights upliftin' the woman
For that are superior to handle by any male
Any time, any rhyme, any flow and any show
And if you ask my producers that we fly and you know

You can't play with my Yo-Yo
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
You can't play with my Yo-Yo
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out

My name is Yo-Yo, I'm not a ho
I like to flow so swift, it's got to be a gift
So yo, let the beat lift, as I rip and rhyme
And rap and slap all the girls who came to dap
To the fact I get the 8-ball or the jam

The earrings I wear are called dophins
Check the booty, yo it's kinda soft
And if you touch, you livin' in a coffin
(Word to mother)
I'm in the 90s, your still in the 80s right

I rock the mic, they say I'm not lady like
But I'ma lady, who will pull a stunt though
I kill suckas and even hit the block
So what you wanna do? Ya must play it wrong
(Aay yo)

'Cause to me, you simply can't get none
You wetter, than a hotter ho in snow
Tell 'em Ice Cube
(Ice Cube)
No, you can't play with my Yo-Yo, suckas

You can't play with my Yo-Yo
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
You can't play with my Yo-Yo
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out

What's yo name baby?

That's right, my name is Yo-Yo
But know I'm not a dunkin
As I rap, chilly chill bringin' the funk
And I steal yo man, as if he was a hawk
And he'll call me baby, yo, or even pumpkin

I may be buttercup or even Ms.Yo
We had dinner and know we drinkin' Cisco
Hit the slow jams, its gettin' cosy
Your home alone, so now you gettin' nosy

Your kinda young, so of course you had to call replace
Hang up in my face, it's a sad case
So who ya man dippin' the dollars, what?
Yup, for puttin' lipstick on his collar

At home, he's gotta listen to ya holla
But he'll slap ya and sock ya, so why bother?
But if you come knockin' at my do'
(Ay yo)
I'll smoke you, tell 'em Ice

You can't play wit my Yo-Yo, sucka

You can't play with my Yo-Yo
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
You can't play with my Yo-Yo
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out

Fool, 1990 and stand sucka free, yeah
Tell 'em what's up

Yo, I hope you realize one day
That ya week is Monday threw Sunday
So listen to my Y O, here's my bio
And next to me, ha, your not fly yo

Ya lack skills to be a woman that's black
Fake hair in the back, plus green contacts
Yo-Yo is just tryna to stop ya
Because the world ain't a big soap opera

It only takes one punch to drop ya
And then the I.B.W.C. will come mob ya
But no, I'm not livin' like that first
Although I pack a real small gat in my purse
(Right, right)

Just no, it's not to cause corruptions
Just to fight back on the instructions
Just thought you wanna know about the Y O Y O
Yo, should I tell 'em Ice

They know what time it is

You can't play with my Yo-Yo
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
You can't play with my Yo-Yo
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out

Yo-Yo, the brand new intelligent black lady
Stompin' to the 90s, for all y'all suckas
Aye Jinx, I knew they couldn't fade it
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo

The simple to a metaphor, make someone to yell on
To keep it at a latest while they're yellin', more, more
I am very versatile, changin' my ways to different styles
Knowledge is the key, expense is for my background

Label me as a woman and sometimes I feel inferior
Follow me on the hands of time, makes no man superior
Should we jam and take the stand, and dis back all the
Men who know no more the slang, slang

And thinks wit his ding-a-ling?
I think it's time that we defeat
And stand on our own two feet
If we wanna live wit justice and harmony

How many more rounds must I go
In order to let my people know
Times were hard, things have changed
Don't try to play me out

Lady
(Don't try to play me out)
Yay, yay, hey
(Don't try to play me out)
Yay, yay, yay, yay
