Little Boo Boo God's got 'em and I'm gonna miss everybody

When playing with destiny, play too deep for me to say
Lil' Layzie came to me, told me if he should decease well then please
Bury me by my gran-gran and when you can, come follow me

God bless you workin' on a plan to Heaven
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days, God is who we praise
even though the devil's all up in my face
But he keeping me safe and in my place, say grace
to the gates we race without a chance to face the judge
And I guess my soul won't budge
Grudge because there's no mercy for thugs
Ooh, what can I do, it's all about our family and how we roll
Can I get a witness not a new foe
We living our lives to eternal our soul aye-oh-aye-oh

Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
and we pray, and we pray, and we pray, and we pray

Whether it's Hell or it's Heaven
Come let's go take a visit of people that's long gone
Wally, Eazy, Terry, Boo
Instead of keepin' up with they family
Exactly how many days we got lasting
While you laughing, we're passing, passing away
God rest your souls
Cause I know I might meet you up at the crossroads
Y'all know, that forever got love from them Bone Thugs baby

Lil Eazy's long gone
Really wish he would come home
But when it's time to die
Gotta go bye bye
All a lil; thug could do is cry, cry
Why'd they kill my dog and man I miss my uncle Charles y'all
He shoudn't be gone, in front of his home
What they did to Boo was wrong
Oh so wrong, oh so wrong
Gotta hold on gotta stay strong
When the day comes
Better believe Bone got a shoulder you can lean on (lean on)
