[big daddy kane]
The question at hand, is how do i love thee?
I count the ways but girls don't shove me
One by one you can come and caress me
Undress and molest me but you can't posess me
Because i love a young lady that's beautiful
But one that's smart for me, is more suitable
In other words, to make it simple and plain
You gotta have a brain in order to be ms. kane
But in the case of not becomin my lady
I take em eight to eighty, dumb crippled and crazy
Crisp and clean with no caffeine
And a pair of spandex or either tight jeans
Couldn't believe the ones with the chinese cunt
But i'll take em with the weave hangin down to they butts
And if you step up in a large sum
Like martin luther king, i shall overcome
I get the job done

Chorus (+ kane says "i get the job done!" every two lines)

[big daddy kane]
Some of you ladies make moves too quick
And settle down, without havin a large pick
Rushin to becomin some pooh-butt's wife
And no longer do you enjoy, the married life
Well, i let you know this is a brand new year
So never fear, the big daddy is here
To do things in places your husband wouldn't
And do certain things he probably just couldn't
Let me sneak into your life, like a thief in the night
Lick your body all over and squeeze you real tight
Nibble all over your ear and give your back a massage
You'll say, "oooh i like it just like debarge" (how large)
Smooth and mild i'll make you smile
Honey child and if you like then get buckwild
And when i turn her back on, you'll have to say
Like calgon, please take me away
So when your main course is doin nothin for ya
Just look at me as a tasty side order
That came into your life and brought a thrill
Cause any husband won't, i'm a neighbor who will, get the job done..

Chorus (+ kane says "i get the job done!" every two lines)

[kane]	t.r., take it to the bridge, uhh!

[big daddy kane]
Here's a perfect description of me
Six foot one, and dark and lovely
And if they're sayin black is beautiful, it's true not phony
I'm brown-er than bobby so won't you be my +tenderoni+
And get a whiff of this nymphomaniac
And uhh, the date mack is ready to attack
And prove that i'm a pro and far from a rookie
Ain't no hair on my chest, but i'm one tough cookie
Whoever said you had to be one-hundred percent
Masculine in order to be in?
I'd rather be more subtle and smooth and sooth
Girl, you won't disapprove
And i promise that you'll never forget
Hmmmmmmmmmmm, now what's a title to fit me?
A champ like tyson, a captain like kirk, no
Employee of the month, cause yo, i do work
The k-a-n-e is on the j-o-b
An expert, cause i get it d-o-n-e
So lights, camera, action - all hail the one!
That gets the job done
