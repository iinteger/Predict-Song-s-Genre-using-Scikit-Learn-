Run D.M.C.
Miscellaneous
It's Like That
[Run] 
Unemployment at a record highs 
People coming, people going, people born to die 
Don't ask me, because I don't know why 
But it's like that, and that's the way it is 

[D.M.C.] 
People in the world tryin to make ends meet 
You try to ride car, train, bus, or feet 
I said you got to work hard, you want to compete 
It's like that, and that's the way it is 
Huh! 

[Run &amp; D.M.C. alternate lines for the remainder of the song] 
Money is the key to end all your woes 
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows 
Won't you tell me the last time that love bought you clothes? 
It's like that, and that's the way it is 

Bills rise higher every day 
We receive much lower pay 
I'd rather stay young, go out and play 
It's like that, and that's the way it is 
Huh! 

Wars going on across the sea 
Street soldiers killing the elderly 
Whatever happened to unity? 
It's like that, and that's the way it is 

Disillusion is the word 
That's used by me when I'm not heard 
I just go through life with my glasses blurred 
It's like that, and that's the way it is 
Huh! 

You can see a lot in this lifespan 
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can 
You noticed one time he was your man 
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is 

You should have gone to school, you could've learned a trade 
But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid 
Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid 
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is 
Huh! 

One thing I know is that life is short 
So listen up homeboy, give this a thought 
The next time someone's teaching why don't you get taught? 
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is 

If you really think about it times aren't that bad 
The one that flexes with successes will make you glad 
Stop playing start praying, you won't be sad 
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is 
Huh! 

When you feel you fail sometimes it hurts 
For a meaning in life is why you search 
Take the bus or the train, drive to school or the church 
It's like that, and that's the way it is 

Here's another point in life you should not miss 
Do not be a fool who's prejudiced
Because we're all written down on the same list 
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is 
Huh!

You know it's like that, and that's the way it is 
Because it's like that, and that's the way it is
