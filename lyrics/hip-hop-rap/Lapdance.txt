When you think of Harvey, think of a Harley
Blue denim, spiked wrists and gone be
Lap-screws and tattoos that's all me
Two guns, both arms spinnin' like Fonzie
You can find me drunk, whip it it might crash
Or find me chillin' with crackers who like thrash
Find me in court smokin' that nice grass
Burnin' the flag, all in the name of white trash
It's Harvey, baby, Christ on the arm- I'm lawly, baby
Fuck with me? Not hardly, baby
And you know the flow unguardly, baby
So let's party, baby
Chicks nickname me Prador, they get high off my dick
I take 'em to my home, they call it the cock pit
Time for take off, their panties they drop quick
Now that's first class fuckin', ain't that some fly shit?

Oooh, baby, you want me?
Oooh, baby, you want me?
Oooh, baby, you want me?
Well, you can get this lap dance here for free
