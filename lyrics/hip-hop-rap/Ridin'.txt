They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty

Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty

My music so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty

Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty

Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tense, so it ain't easy to be seen
When you see me ride by they can see the gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen

Now ridin' with a new chick, she like, "Hold up"
Next to the PlayStation controlla
Is a full clip and my pistola
Send a jacker into a coma

Girl you ain't know I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryin' ta bone, ain't tryin' to have no babies
Ride clean as hell, so I pull in ladies
Laws on patrol and you know they hate me

Music turned all the way up and to the maximum
I got speakers, some ****** tryin' ta jack for some
But we packin' somethin' and what we have for 'um
We'll have a ***** locked up in a maximum, security cell

I'm grippin oak
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow
Twins steady twistin' like, "Hit this dough"
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat

Windows down, gotta stop pollution
City change just like, "Who is that producin?"
That's the Play 'N Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston
But I still ain't losin'

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty

Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty

My music so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty

Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty

I've been drinking and smokin'
Holy **** 'cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home before the po-po's scope this
Big ole Excursion swervin', all up in the curb and

A ***** been sippin' on the Hennessey and the gin again
It's in again, we in the wind
Don't wanna hold up while I puff on the blunt
I roll another one up, and leave it like we ain't givin' a ****

I got a blunt up in my right hand
40 oz. in my lap, freezin' my *****
Rollin' up a tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep me and my dogs

Yo' I gotta hit the back streets
Wanted by the six-five says I got heat
Glock, glock shots to the block, we creep creep
Pop pop, hope cops don't see me on the low key

With no regard for the law
We dodge 'em like, "***k 'em all"
But I won't get caught up
And brought up on charges for none of y'all

Keep a gun in car and a blunt to spark
Wonder if you want ***** it poppin' dog
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air
Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty

Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty

My music so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty

Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty

You wouldn't think it so, I tried ta let cha go
Turn on my blanker light, and then I swang it slow
And they upset for fa sho, 'cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro'

So they get behind me, tryin' ta catch my tags
Look in my rearview and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep tryin'
And denyin' that it's racial profilin'

Houston, Texas you can check my tags
Pull me over, try to check my slab
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast

And bein' the balla that I am, I talk to them
Not givin' a damn about them not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood

I'ma laugh at you then I have to cruise
Ya my number two on some old school DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the laws, tell 'em, "We hate you"

I could be tough, tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, findin' a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me, I'm bout to pull up at your home
And it's on

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty

Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty

My music so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty

Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty

Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty

My music so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty

Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' ta catch me ridin' dirty
