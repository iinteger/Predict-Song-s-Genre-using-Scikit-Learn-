Let's do it

Workin' all week
9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes
I go get live with the honey

Rollin' down the street
I saw this girl and she was pumpin'
I winked my eye, she got into the ride
Went to a club was jumpin'

Introduce myself as Loc
She said, "You're a liar"
I said, "I got it goin' on baby doll
And I'm on fire"

Took her to the hotel she said
"You're the king"
I said, "Be my queen if you know what I mean
And let us do the wild thing

Wild thing
Wild thing

Shoppin' at the mall
Looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl she cool rocked my world
And I had to adjust my fly

She looked at me and smiled and said
"You have plans for the night"
I said, "Hopefully if things go
Well, I'll be with you tonight"

So we journeyed to her house
One thing led to an other
I keyed the door, I cold hit the floor
Looked up and it was her mother

I didn't know what to say
I was hanging by a string
She said, "Hey, you two, I was once like you
And I liked to do the wild thing"

Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please, baby, baby, please

Posse in effect
Hangin' out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig
I want a girl who's just my type

Saw this luscious little frame
I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss
And I knew that she was mine

Took her to the limousine
Still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over
And I gave her my own ride

Couldn't get her off my jack
She was like static cling
But that's what happens
When body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing

Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing
Please, baby, baby, please

Wild thing

Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine youg chick was on my jack so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said, "Chill for now but maybe later, you'll get your chance"

So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said, "Tone, let me tell you one thing
I need Dollar 50 to make you holler, I get paid to do the wild thing"

Say what
Yo love you must be kidding
You're walkin' babe
Just break out of here
Hasta la vista baby

Wild thing
