You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent
Because a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit

You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent
Will have a whole lot of bitches jumpin' ship

In my eyes I done seen some crazy thangs in the streets

Gotta couple hoes workin' on the changes for me
But I gotta keep my game tight like Kobe on game night
Like takin' from a hoe don't know no better, I know that ain't right
The same people kill, The same people deal

The same people live in poverty with no meals
It's fucked up where I live but that's just how it is
It might be new to you but it's been like this for years
It's blood sweat and tears when it come down to this shit
I'm tryin' to get rich 'fore I leave up out it
I'm tryin' to have thangs but it's hard for a pimp

So I'm prayin' and I'm hopin' to God I don't slip, yeah
You know it's hard out here for a pimp

When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent

Because a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit

You know it's hard out here for a pimp

Man, it seems like I'm duckin' dodgin' bullets everyday
Niggaz hatin' on me cause I got, hoes on the tray
But I gotta stay paid, gotta stay above water
Couldn't keep up with my hoes, that's when shit got harder

North Memphis where I'm from, I'm 7th street bound

Where niggaz all the time end up lost and never found
Man, these girls think we prove thangs, leave a big head
They come hopin' every night, they don't end up bein' dead
Wait I got a snow bunny, and a black girl too
You pay the right price and they'll both do you
That's the way the game goes, gotta keep it strictly pimpin'
Gotta keep my hustle tight, makin' change off these women, yeah
