Sittin' at home with my dick on hard
So I got the black book for a freak to call
Picked up the telephone, then dialed the 7 digits
Said, "Yo, this Marquis, baby, are you down with it?"

I arrived at her house, knocked on the door
Not having no idea of what the night had in store
I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warnin'
I have an appetite for sex, 'cause me so horny

Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny
Me love you long time
Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny

Girls, always ask me, why I fuck so much
I say, what's wrong, baby doll, with a quick nut?
'Cause you're the one, and you shouldn't be mad
I won't tell your mama, if you don't tell your dad

I know, he'll be disgusted when he sees your pussy busted
Won't your mama be so mad if she knew I got that ass?
I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warnin'
My appetite is sex, 'cause me so horny

Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny
Me love you long time
Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny
Me love you long time

You can say, I'm desperate, even call me perverted
But you say, I'm a dog when I leave you fucked and deserted
I'll play with your heart just like it's a game
I'll be blowin' your mind, while you're blowin' my brains

I'm just like that man they call, Georgie Puddin' Pie
I fuck all the girls and I make 'em cry
I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warnin'
I have an appetite for sex, 'cause me so horny

It's true, you were a virgin until you met me
I was the first to make you hot and wetty-wetty
You tell your parents that we're goin' out
Never to the movies, just straight to my house

You said it yourself, you like it like I do
Put your lips on my dick, and suck my asshole too
I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warnin'
My appetite is sex, 'cause me so horny
