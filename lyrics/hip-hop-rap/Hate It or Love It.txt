Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

Comin' up I was confused, my mommy kissin' a girl
Confusion occurs, comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, "Check, check out 'My Melody'"

I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope

Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin', niggaz had stolen my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

I told Dre from the gate "I'd carry the heat for ya"
First mixtape song I inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya, G-G-G-G for ya
Put Compton on my back when you in need of soldiers

At my last show I threw away my N.W.A. gold
I had the whole crowd yellin', "Free Yayo"
So niggaz better get up outta mine
For I creep and turn your projects into Columbine

And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C.
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us 'cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend

And it seems your lil' rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly South
Even Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out
Who gave the West coast mouth-to-mouth?

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

From the beginnin' to the end, losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change it's stayin' the same

How many of them boys is witcha'?
When you had that little TV, you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walking with a snub, 'cause niggaz do a lot of slick talkin'
In the club 'til they coughin' on the rug
Ain't never had much but a Walkman and a bud

My role model is gone snortin' up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat
Now it's an Auggie shirt and my coat

Now I'm speedin', reminiscin', holdin' my weed in
Never listen if I see him I'ma lift 'em
And maybe that'll even the score
But if not, it'll be me on the floor

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

I started out at 15, scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and made them sales
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that lil' deuce-deuce and my triple fat goose

Sippin, 'Easy Jesus', rockin' a leases
My momma wit me when she found my pieces
I look back on life, thank God I'm blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest

You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look man, it's a hood thang that's why I'm loved in Brooklyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time homey, I'm still all good

Let me show you what a thug 'bout I'm born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 put 'em in my fo'-five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
