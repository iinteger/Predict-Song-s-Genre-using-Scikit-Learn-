You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge.

1 (Ice Cube)
Straight outta Compton
Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggaz With Attitudes.
When I'm called off
I got a sawed off.
Squeeze the trigger
And bodies are hauled off.
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass. That's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggaz start to mumble
They want to rumble
Mix them and cook them in a pot like Gumbo.
Going off on a motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass.
So give it up smooth.
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move.
Here's a murder rap to keep ya dancing
With a crime record like Charles Manson.
AK-47 is the tool.
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool.
Me and you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking niggaz out the box daily.
Yo weekly, monthly, and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T.
Boy, you can't fuck with me.
So when I'm in your neighborhood
You better duck
'cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck.
As I leave, believe I'm stomping

But when I come back, boy

I'm coming straight outta Compton.

Straight outta Compton, Straight outta Compton

2 (MC Ren)
Yo' Ren!
Wassup?
Tell 'em where ya' from
Straight outta Compton
Another crazy ass nigga.
More punks I smoke
Yo my rep gets bigger.
I'm a bad motherfucker and you know this
But the pussy ass niggaz won't show this.
But I don't give a fuck, I'mma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking, or craps.
It's like burglary, the definition is jacking
Or when illegally armed, it's called packing.
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy, and go up in it.
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'mma call you a bitch or a dirty ass 'ho.
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me what you're composed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street.
Attitude legit, 'cause I'm tearing up shit.
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static.
Not the right hand, 'cause I'm the hand itself
Every time, I pull a AK off the shelf.

Security is maximum and that's a law.
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw.
See, 'cause I'm the motherfucking villain.

The definition is clear

You're the witness of a killing
That's taking place without a clue.
And once you're on the scope

Your ass is through.
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangster tip.
Straight outta Compton.
Straight outta Compton, Staright outta Compton
3 (Eazy-E)
Robin is his name, and the boy's commin'
Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her.
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught I make bail.
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem.
I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see the punk pass, I smile.
To me it's kind of funny
The attitude is showing
Nigga driving
But don't know where the fuck he going.

Just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's the flash: They never seize me.
Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload. You see, it's fun to jump over a hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who caught the lead penetration

Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting
But leave a memory, no one will be forgetting.
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker.
This is an autobiography of the E
And if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother.
Word to the motherfucker.
Straight outta Compton.
Straight outta Compton, Straight outta Compton
Damn, that shit was dope!
