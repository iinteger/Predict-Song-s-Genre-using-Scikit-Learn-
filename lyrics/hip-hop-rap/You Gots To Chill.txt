You gots to chill

Relax your mind let your conscience be free
And get down to the sounds of EPMD
Oh, you should keep quiet while the MC rap
But if you're tired then go take a nap

Or stay awake and watch the show I take
Because right now I'm 'bout to shake an' bake
The E R I C K is my name I spell
Things to the clientele, yo, I rock well

I'm not an MC who' talkin' all that junk
About who can beat who soundin' like a punk
I just get down and I go for mine
Say, check 1-2 and run down a line

To the average MC I'm known as 'The Terminator'
Funky beat maker, new jack exterminator
Destroyin' a ploy when your rhymes are not void
Never sweatin' your girl, why P?, 'Cause she's a skeezoid

When I'm on the scene, I always rock the spot
I grab the steel with the crown on the top
In the beginnin' I like to let my rhymes flow
And at twelve I press cruise control

Sit back and relax, let my rhymes tax
Maintain MC's while the Double E macks
Always calm under pressure, no need to act ill
Listen when I tell you boy, you gots to chill

I be the personal computer, information on rap
Like the B-I-Z Markie says, I'll make your toes tap
I format the rhymes step by step
Make 'em sound deaf to maintain my rep
Prepared to come off in case of a diss

Not worried about a thing, 'cause we can do this
I can turn the party out just by standin' still
Make the ladies scream and shout while the brothers act ill
Take total control of your body and soul
Pack a nine in my pants for when it's time to roll

I'm the P E E M D E E
And one thing I hate is a bitin' MC
When I enter the party suckers always form a line
Then they ease their way up and try to bite my lines

I did thousands of shows, dissed many faces
And deal with new jacks on a one-to-one basis
But every now and then a sucker MC gets courageous
And like an epidemic it becomes contagious

But never the least they all R.I.P
For all those unaware it means Rest In Peace
'Cause M.D stands for Microphone Doctor
And the capital P, capital M, capital D-E-E's no doubt the chief rocker
Don't like to get ill, but if I have to I kill

So believe me boy, you gots to chill
Catch every word I'm sayin', no there's no delayin'
Don't hestitate to motivate the crowd, I'm not playin'
Seeing is believing, you catch my drift
Don't try to adapt because I'm just too swift

How swift? I'm so swift and that's an actual fact
I'm like Zorro, I mark a E on your back
I don't swing on no ropes or no iron cords
The only weapon is my rappin' sword

Intimidate MC's with the tone of my vocal drone
When I'm pushin' on the microphone
'Cause I'm the funky rhyme maker, MC undertaker
The one who likes to max and relax

And, when it's time, issue diggum-smacks
I keep their hands clappin', fingers snappin', feet tappin'
When it's time to roll Uzi patrol's packin'
The Pee MD, the mic's my only friend

And through the course of the party I kill again and again
So if you're thinkin' 'bout battlin' you better come prepared
Come wit' your shield and your armoured gear
You gots to chill
