Flirtatious, tryin' to show faces, ah

What good is all the fame if you ain't fuckin' the models?
I see you drivin' a sportscar, ain't hittin' the throttle
And I be down, and do a hundred, top down and goggles
Get off the freeway, exit 106 and parked it
Ash tray, flipped it, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game 'cuz baby I can't talk it
Warm, sweatin' it's hot up in this joint
Vocalk, tanktop, all on at this point
You're with a winner so baby you can't lose

I got secrets, can't leave Cancun
So take it off like your home alone

You know dance in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checkin' your reflection and tellin' your best friend
Like, "Girl I think my butt gettin' big"
