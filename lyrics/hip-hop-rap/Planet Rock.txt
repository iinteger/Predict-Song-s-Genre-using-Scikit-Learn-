Party people, party people
Can y'all get funky?
Soul Sonic Force, can y'll get funky?
The Zulu Nation, can y'll get funky?

Ya, Just hit me
Just taste the funk and hit me
Just get on down and hit me
Bambaataa's jus' gettin' so funky, now hit me
Ya, just hit me

Just start to chase your dreams
Up out your seats, make your body sway
Socialize, get down, let your soul lead the way

Shake it now, go ladies, it's a livin' dream
Love, life, live
Come play the game, our world is free
Do what you want but scream

We know a place where the nights are hot
It is a house of funk
Females and males
Both headed all for the disco

The DJ plays your favorite blasts
Takes you back to the past, music's magic, poof
Bump, bump, bump, get bump with some flash, people

Rock, rock to the Planet Rock, don't stop
Rock, rock to the Planet Rock, don't stop

The Soul Sonic Force, Mr. Biggs, Pow Wow and MC Globe
We emphasize the show, we got ego
Make this your night, just slip it right and by day

As the people say, live it up, shucks
No work or play, our world is free
Be what you be, so be

Rock, rock to Planet Rock, don't stop
Rock, rock to Planet Rock, don't stop

You're in a place where the nights are hot
Where nature's children dance and set a chance
On this Mother Earth, which is our rock

The time has come and work for soul, show you really got soul
Are you ready hump, bump, bump, get bump, now let's go, house

Twist and turn, [Incomprehensible]
You got the body rock and pop, bounce and pounce

Everybody just rock it, don't stop it

You gotta rock it, pop it, 'cause it's the century
There is such a place that creates such a melody
Our world is but a land of a master jam, get up and dance
It's time to chase your dreams

Up out your seats, make your body sway
Socialize, get down, let your soul lead the way
Shake it now, go ladies, it's a livin' dream
Love, life, live
