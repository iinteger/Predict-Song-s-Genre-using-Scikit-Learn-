Yo Ease let's do this...

Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors...

I am a nightmare walking, Psychopath talking,
King of my jungle, just a gangster stalking,
Living life like a firecracker, quick is my fuse,
Then dead as a deathpack the colors I choose,
Red or Blue, Cuz or Blood, it just don't matter,
Sucker die for your life when my shotgun scatters,
Colors,
We gangs of L.A. will never die - just multiply colors,

Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors...

You don't know me, fool,
You disown me, cool,
I don't need your assistance, social persistence,
Any problem I got I just put my fist in,
Colors,
My life is violent but violent is life,
Peace is a dream, reality is a knife,
My colors, my honor, my colors, my all,
With my colors upon me one soldier stands tall,
Tell me what have you left me, what have I got,
Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot,
My homeboy got jacked,
My mother's on crack,
My sister can't work cause her arms show trax,
Madness, insanity, live in profanity,
Then some punk claimin' they understandin' me,
Give me a break, what world do you live in,
Death is my sect, guess my religion,

Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors...

My pants are saggin', braided hair,
suckers stare, but I don't care,
My game ain't knowledge, my game's fear,
I've no remorse, so squares beware,

But my true mission, is just revenge,
You ain't in my sect, you ain't my friend,
Wear the wrong color your life could end,
Homicide's my favorite binge,
Colors,

Colors, ka, ka, ka, colors, colors, ka, ka, ka, colors, colors, ka, ka, ka, colors, colors, ka, ka, ka, colors, colors, ka, ka, ka, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors...

So I'll just walk like a giant, police defiant,
You'll say to stop, but I'll say that I can't,
My gangs my family its all that I have,
I'm a star, on the walls is my autograph,

You don't like it, so you know where you can go,
Cause' the streets are my stage and terror's my show,
Phsyco-analize tried diognising me why,
It wasn't your brother that brutally died,

But it was mine, so let me define,
My territory, don't cross the line,
Don't try to act crazy,
Cause' that shit don't phase me,
If you ran like a punk,
It wouldn't amaze me,
Cause' my color is death,
Though we all want peace,
But our war won't end,
Till all wars cease,

Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, ka, ka, ka, colors, colors, ka, ka, ka, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, ka, ka, ka, khh, colors, ka, ka, ka, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, khh, ka, ka, ka, colors, colors, ka, ka, ka, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, colors, ka, ka, ka, ka, ka, ka, colors...
