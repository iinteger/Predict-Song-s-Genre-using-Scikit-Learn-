The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
(The freaks come out)
The freaks come out at night

Discos don't open till after dark
And it ain't till twelve till the party really starts
And I always had to be home by ten
Right before the fun was about to begin

Crowds of people lined up inside and out
Just one reason to rock the house
But in the day time the streets was clear
You couldn't find a good freak anywhere 'cause

The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
(The freaks come out)
The freaks come out at night

Now when freaks get dressed to go out at night
They like to wear leather jackets, chains and spikes
They wear rips and zippers all in their shirts
Real tight pants and fresh mini skirts

All kinds of colors runnin' through their hair
And you could just about find a freak anywhere
But then again, you could know someone all their life
But might not know they're a freak unless you see them at night 'cause

The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
(The freaks come out)
The freaks come out at night

Now the party's jumpin', the place is packed
And when the crowd's like this, I'm ready to rap
But before I could bust a rhyme on the mic
Freaks are all over me like white on rice

Freaks come in all shapes, sizes and colors
But what I like about 'em most is that they're real good lovers
They do it in the park, they do it in the dark
But most freaks are known for breakin' hearts

You could never tell what a freak was thinkin' of
And you may never catch a freak without at least one glove
And they don't walk, when they step, they strut
And nine times out of ten they drive you nuts

But take my advice, you don't stand a chance
Freaks are so bad, they got their own dance
So if you wanna live a nice quiet life
Do yourself a favor, don't come out at night 'cause

The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
(The freaks come out)
The freaks come out at night

Hut one, hut two
Hut, hut, hut

The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
