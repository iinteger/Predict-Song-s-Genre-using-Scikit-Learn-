I told ya I'm the colonel of this muthafuckin' tank
Don't make me get rowdy and start pullin rank
My comrads with tanks
With diamonds and TRU tats
We make em say 'uhhhh'
An' 'how ya do that'
third ward hustlaz
On these streets chasin' riches
Penetentury chances
Cause this a risky buissiness
A No Limit Souldier
Commanderin' Cheif
An' Michael Jackson
Can't rock a muthafuckin' party like me
I'm bumpin' for the real niggaz, playaz, and hustlaz
Qualified killaz, certified head-bustaz
Got love for the North, South, East, to the West
Soldierz throw ya rag, Killaz how ya' vest
Flashin' red lights
Runnin' from the rollerz
If life was a movie, 'CUT'
Pass me the dojah

Chorus:
Make em say uhh

Fiend:
Well, if ya knew
something. Fiend
still tryin' to do somethin'
TRU smokaz dont gotta blow
We done already blew sumpthin
I still want the green, cornbread, and the cabbage
No Limit savage
One known as the baddest
When I was bustin out expeditions you wasnt ready
Bangin like soft black cannon
Bangin' out the 4-7
Lyrically a machete  
I dig da dirt and bury
Fiend, the excited private on any mercinary
I hurt an' make you worry
Like this were you
Can't get get a tank dog salute
P's already suit
I represent the boot
An' the world is rowdy, rowdy
Makin' you say uhhh
with the colonol, Mr. Bout it

Chorus x2

Silkk:
P gon' make ya say uhhh
I'm gon' make ya say ahhhhhhh
But this time I'm gon' get rowdy by sayin na na na na na
I'm a cash deala'
A No Limit ass kicka'
I'm a bad nigga
Fast nigga
Ain't the last nigga
keep my mind on my money because I like riches
House full of tight bitches
An' call me, I might hitcha
Now make em say na na na
Tryin ta act hard core
Betta for the flow 
Na na na na na na
Now get the ball loose
Kick the boot an drop the verse (64-5)
I'm tryin' to clock the scrilla 
But it's hard not to hurt
Now I'm a No Limit soldier
So I get my strength through my duties
Bout to make em scream 'MISTER'
Like the movie (na na na na na)

Chorus x2

Mia X:
You know we showed you once before the tank couldn't be stopped
Playa hataz jack alot cause they just jockin' they spot

Snoop Dogg:
Man, I'm smokin' on some chop-chop from S-G-V

Top rank, best dank mo' bank in dis game
Who could t be? Ya'll know my muthafuckin' name
