Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin
I came to win, battle me, that's a sin
I won't tear the sack up, punk you'd better back up
Try and play the role and yo, the whole crew will act up

Get up, stand up, come on, throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling jump across the ceiling
Muggs is a funk fest, someone's talking junk
Yo, I'll bust 'em in the eye and then I'll take the punks home

Feel it, funk it, amps it are junking
And I got more rhymes than there's cops that are dunking
Donuts shop, sure 'nuff I got props from the kids on the hill
Plus my mom and my pops

I came to get down
I came to get down
So get out your seats and jump around
Jump around

Jump around
Jump around
Jump up, jump up
And get down

Jump
Jump
Jump

I'll serve your ass like John Macenroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the ho
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got psalms

And just like the prodigal son I've returned
Anyone stepping on me, you'll get burned
'Cause I got lyrics and you ain't got none
So if you come to battle, bring a shotgun

But if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel to the death
Tryin' to step me, you'll take your last breath
I got the skill, come get your fill
'Cause when I shoot to give, I shoot to kill

I came to get down
I came to get down
So get out your seats and jump around
Jump around

Jump around
Jump around
Jump up, jump up
And get down

Jump
Jump
Jump

I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig, 'cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a terminator, like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Tryin' to play me out like as if my name was Sega

But I ain't going out like no punk, bitch
Get used to one style and you know I might switch
It up up and around, then buck buck you down
Put out your head then you wake up in the dawn of the dead

I'm coming to get ya
I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics
Homie I'll wet ya

I came to get down
I came to get down
So get out your seats and jump around
Jump around

Jump around
Jump around
Jump up, jump up
And get down

Jump
Jump
Jump
