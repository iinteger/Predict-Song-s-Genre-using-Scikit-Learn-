Hit it now

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me mirror what is wrong?
Can it be my De La clothes
Or is it just my De La song?

What I do ain't make-believe
People say I sit and try
When it comes to being De La
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Now you tease my Plug One style
And my Plug One spectacles
You say Plug One and Two are hippies
No, we're not, that's pure Plug bull

Always pushing that we've formed an image
There's no need to lie
When it comes to being Plug One
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Proud, I'm proud of what I am
Poems I speak are Plug Two type
Please, oh, please let Plug Two be
Himself not what you read or write

Right is wrong when hype is written
On the Soul, De La that is
Style is surely our own thing
Not the false disguise of showbiz

De La Soul is from the soul
And this fact I can't deny
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie
And from me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Glory, glory Hallelu
Glory for Plugs One and Two
But that glory's been denied
By kizids and dookie eyes

People think they dis my person
By stating I'm darkly pack
I know this so I point at Q Tip
And he states, "Black is black"

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Shovel chestnuts in my path
Please keep on up with the nuts
So I don't get in aftermath

But if I do I'll calmly punch them
In the fourth day of July
'Cause they tried to mess with
Third degree, that's me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
