I'm gonna wrap my arms around my Daddy's neck
And tell Him that I've missed Him
And tell Him all about the man that I became
And hope that it pleased Him

There's so much I wanna say
There's so much I wanted You to know
When I finally make it home
When I finally make it home

Then I gazed upon the throne of the King
Frozen in my steps
And all the questions that I swore I would ask
Words just won't come, yeah

I'm so amazed in what I've seen
So much more than this old mind can hold
When I finally make it home
When I finally make it home

And the sweetest sound these ears will get to hear
The voices of the angels
When I finally make it home
When I finally make it home
