The thought that I was all alone
Broken and afraid
But You were there with me
Yes You were there with me

Well and I didn't even know
That I had lost my way
But You were there with me
Yes You were there with me

Until You opened up my eyes I never knew
That I couldn't ever make it without You

And even though the journey's long
And I know the road is hard
Well, the one who's gone before me
He will help me carry on

And after all that I've been through
Now I realize the truth
That I must go through the valley
To stand upon the mountain of God

And as I travel on the road
That You have lead me down
You are here with me
Yes You are here with me

And I have need for nothing more
Oh now that I have found
That You are here with me
Yes You are here with me

Well I confess from time to time I lose my way
But You are always there to bring me back again

Even though the journey's long
And I know the road is hard
Well the one who's gone before me
He will help me carry on

And after all that I've been through
Well now I realize the truth
That I must go through the valley
To stand upon the mountain of God

Sometimes I think of where it is I've come from
And the things I've left behind
But of all I've had and what I possessed
Nothing can quite compare with what's in front of me
With what's in front of me

And even though the journey's long
And I know the road is hard
Well the one who's gone before me
He will help me carry on

And after all that I've been through
Well now I realize the truth
That I must go through the valley
To stand upon the mountain

Yes I must go through the valley
To stand upon the mountain
Yes I must go through the valley
To stand upon the mountain

The thought that I was all alone
Broken and afraid
But You are here with me
Yes You are here with me
