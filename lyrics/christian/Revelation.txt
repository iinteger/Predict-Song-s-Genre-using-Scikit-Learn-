My life has led me down the road that's so uncertain
And now, I am left alone and I am broken
Trying to find my way
Trying to find the faith that's gone

This time I know that You are holding all the answers
And I'm tired of losing hope and taking chances
On roads that never seem
To be the ones that bring me home

Give me a revelation
Show me what to do
â€~Cause I've been trying
To find my way
I haven't got a clue

Tell me should I stay here
Or do I need to move?
Give me a revelation
I've got nothing without You
I've got nothing without You

My life has led me down this path that's ever winding
Through every twist and turn, I'm always finding
That I am lost again
Tell me when this road will ever end

Give me a revelation
Show me what to do
â€~Cause I've been trying
To find my way
I haven't got a clue

Tell me should I stay here
Or do I need to move?
Give me a revelation
I've got nothing without You
I've got nothing without

I don't know where I can turn
Tell me, when will I learn?
Won't You show me where I need to go?
Let me follow Your lead
I know that it's the only way that I can get back home

Give me a revelation
Show me what to do
â€~Cause I've been trying
To find my way
I haven't got a clue

Tell me should I stay here
Or do I need to move?
Give me a revelation
I've got nothing without You
I've got nothing without You

No, oh no, oh no
Oh, give me a revelation
Oh Lord, oh no
I've got nothing, now, without You
I've got nothing, now, without You
