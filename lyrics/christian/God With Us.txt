Who are we
That You would be mindful of us?
What do You see
That's worth looking our way?

We are free
In ways that we never should be
Sweet release
From the grip of these chains

Like hinges straining
From the weight
My heart no longer
Can keep from singing

All that is within me cries
For You alone be glorified
Emmanuel
God with us

My heart sings a brand new song
The debt is paid, these chains are gone
Emmanuel
God with us

Lord, You know
Our hearts don't deserve Your glory
Still You show
A love we cannot afford

Like hinges straining
From the weight
My heart no longer
Can keep from singing

All that is within me cries
For You alone be glorified
Emmanuel
God with us

My heart sings a brand new song
The debt is paid, these chains are gone
Emmanuel
God with us

Such a tiny offering
Compared to Calvary
And nevertheless
We lay it at Your feet

Such a tiny offering
Compared to Calvary
And nevertheless
We lay this at Your feet

All that is within me cries
For You alone be glorified
Emmanuel
God with us

My heart sings a brand new song
My debt is paid, these chains are gone
Emmanuel
God with us
