Great is Your faithfulness, O God of Jacob
You wrestle with the sinner's restless heart
You lead me by still waters into mercy

Where nothing can keep us apart.
So, remember Your people

Remember Your children

Remember Your promise, O God.
For Your grace is enough.
Yes, Your grace is enough

Your grace is enough for me
Great is Your love and justice, God of Jacob

You use the weak to lead the strong
You lead us in the song of Your salvation
and all Your people sing along.
So, remember Your people
Remember Your children
Remember Your promise, O God.
Your grace is enough.
Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough for me
Yeah, Your grace is enough.
Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough for me
Remember Your people
Remember Your children
Remember Your promise, O God.
Your grace is enough.
Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough for me
Yeah, Your grace is enough
Heaven reaches out to us
Your grace is enough for me
God I sing your grace is enough
I'm covered in Your love
Your grace is enough for me, for me
It's enough for me
