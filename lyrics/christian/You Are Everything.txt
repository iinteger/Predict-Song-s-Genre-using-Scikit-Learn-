I'm the one with two left feet standing on a lonely street
I can't even walk a straight line
And every time you look at me I'm spinning like an autumn leaf
Bound to hit bottom some time

Where would I be without someone to save me
Someone who won't let me fall?

You are everything that I live for
Everything that I can't believe is happening
You're standing right in front of me with arms wide open
All I know is everyday is filled with hope

'Cause You are everything that I breathe for
And I can't help but breathe
You in and breathe again feeling all this life within
Every single beat of my heart

I'm the one with big mistakes, big regrets
And bigger breaks than I'd ever care to confess
Oh, but You're the one who looks at me
And sees what I was meant to be more than just a beautiful mess

Oh where would I be without someone to save me
Someone who won't let me fall?

You are everything that I live for
Everything that I can't believe is happening
You're standing right in front of me with arms wide open
All I know is everyday is filled with hope

'Cause You are everything that I breathe for
And I can't help but breathe
You in and breathe again feeling all this life within
Every single beat of my heart

You're everything good in my life
Everything honest and true
And all of those stars hanging up in the sky
Could never shine brighter than You

You are everything that I live for
Everything that I can't believe is happening
You're standing right in front of me with arms wide open
All I know is everyday is filled with hope

'Cause You are everything that I breathe for
And I can't help but breathe
You in and breathe again feeling all this life within
Every single beat of my heart

You are, oh You are
Jesus, You are
You are everything
