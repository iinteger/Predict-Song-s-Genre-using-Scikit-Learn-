You look around and staring back at you
Another wave of doubt
Will it pull you under
You wonder

What if I'm overtaken
What if I never make it

What if no one's there
Will you hear my prayer?
When you take that first step
Into the unknown

You know that he won't let you go
So what are you waiting for
What do you have to lose
Your insecurities

They try to hold to you
But you know you're made for more

So don't be afraid to move
Your faith is all it takes
And you can walk on the water too
So get out and let your fear fall to the ground

No time to waste, don't wait
And don't you turn around, and miss out on
Everything you were made for
Gotta be, I know you're not sure, more

So you play it safe, you try to run away
If you take that first step
Into the unknown
He won't let you go

So what are you waiting for
What do you have to lose
Your insecurities
They try to hold to you
But you know you're made for more
So don't be afraid to move
Your faith is all it takes
And you can walk on the water too
Step out, even when it's storming
Step out, even when you're broken
Step out, even when your heart is telling you
Telling you to give up
Step out, when your hope is stolen
Step out, you can't see where you're going
You don't have to be afraid
So what are waiting, what are you waiting for
So what are you waiting for
What do you have to lose
Your insecurities
They try to hold to you
But you know you're made for more
So don't be afraid to move
Your faith is all it takes
And you can walk on the water
Walk on the water too
