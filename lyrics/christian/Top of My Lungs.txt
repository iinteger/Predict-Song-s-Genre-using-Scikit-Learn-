Words of worship
Rise like a river within me
Thoughts to express are so many
I wanna bless You, God

Cant be silent
I think of the mercies You show me
My lips begin overflowing
Great is your Love.

Such gratitude,
For all that You've done,
Jesus to You,

At the top of my lungs
I will sing Hallelujah!
You're the One who saved me,
The One who gave me
This life I live
Forevermore ! Forevermore!

I'm not ashamed.

That rings out across ev'ry nation.
