Come to the water
You who thirst and you'll thirst no more.
Come to the Father
You who work and you'll work no more.

And all you who labor in vain
And to the broken and shamed:

Love is here.
Love is now.
Love is pouring from
His hands, from his brows
Love is near, it satisfies.
Streams of mercy flowing from his side.

Cause love is here.
Come to the treasure
You who search and you'll search no more.
Come to the lover

You who want and you'll want no more, no.
And all you who labor in vain

And to the broken and shamed
Love is here
Love is now
Love is pouring from his hands, from his brows

Love is near, it satisfies
Streams of mercy flowing from his side
Yeah
And to the bruised and fallen
Captives, bound, and broken hearted.
He is the lord

He is the lord
Yeah
By his stripes he's paid our ransom
From his wounds we drink salvation
He is the lord
He is the lord
Love is here
Love is now
Love is pouring from his hands, from his brows
Love is near
It satisfies.
Streams of mercy flowing from his side
Streams of mercy flowing from his side
Cause love is here
Love is here
