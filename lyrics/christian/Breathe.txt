This is the air I breathe
This is the air I breathe
Your Holy presence living in me

This is my daily bread
This is my daily bread
Your very word spoken to me

And I, I'm desperate for You
And I, I'm lost without You

This is the air I breathe
This is the air I breathe
Your Holy presence living in me

This is my daily bread
This is my daily bread
Your very word spoken to me

And I, I'm desperate for You
And I, I'm lost without You
And I, I'm desperate for You
And I, I'm lost without You

I'm lost without You
I'm lost without You
I'm desperate for You
Cry out to Him

I'm desperate for You
Cry out to You
I'm desperate for You
Well I'm lost without You now

I'm desperate for You
I'm desperate for You
I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm lost without You Lord
Yea, I'm lost without You

I'm lost without You
I'm lost without You
I'm desperate for You

How many of you are hungry for God?
Are you hungry for Him?
I want more of Him, who wants the flood gates to open up?
