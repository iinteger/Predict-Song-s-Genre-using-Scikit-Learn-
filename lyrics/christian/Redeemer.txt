Who taught the sun where to stand in the morning?
And who told the ocean you can only come this far?
And who showed the moon where to hide till evening?
Whose words alone can catch a falling star?
Well I know my Redeemer lives
I know my Redeemer lives
All of creation testifies
this life within me cries

I know my Redeemer lives
ye-e-eah
The very same God
that spins things in orbit
runs to the weary, the worn and the weak
and the same gentle hands that hold me when I'm broken

they conquered death to bring me victory
Now I know, my Redeemer lives
I know my Redeemer lives
let all creation testify
Let this life within me cry
I-I-I know
My Redeemer

He lives
to take away my shame
and He lives
forever I'll proclaim
that the payment for my sin

was the precious life He gave
and now He's alive and
there's an empty
grave!
And I know

my Redeemer lives
He lives
I know
my Redeemer lives

let all creation testify
Let this life within me cry
I-I-I know my Redeemer
I know
my Redeemer lives
I know my Redeemer lives
I know, That I know, that I know, that i know, that I know
He lives
Because He lives I can face tomorrow

He lives
I know, I know
He lives
I spoke with Him this morning!
He lives
The tomb is empty
He lives
I'm going to tell everybody!
