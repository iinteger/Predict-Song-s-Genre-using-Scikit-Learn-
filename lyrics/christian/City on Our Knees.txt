If you gotta start somewhere, why not here?
If you gotta start sometime, why not now?
If we gotta start somewhere, I say here
If we gotta start sometime, I say now

Through the fog there is hope in the distance
From cathedrals to third world missions
Love will fall to the earth like a crashing wave

Tonight's the night
For the sinners and the saints
Two worlds collide
In a beautiful display

It's all love tonight
When we step across the line
We can sail across the sea
To a city with one king
A city on our knees
A city on our knees, oh

If you gotta start somewhere, why not here?
If you gotta start sometime, why not now?
If we gotta start somewhere, I say here
If we gotta start sometime, I say now

Through the fog there is hope in the distance
From cathedrals to third world missions
Love will fall to the earth like a crashing wave

Tonight's the night
For the sinners and the saints
Two worlds collide
In a beautiful display

It's all love tonight
When we step across the line
We can sail across the sea
To a city with one king
A city on our knees
A city on our knees, oh

Tonight couldn't last forever
We are one choice from together
Tonight couldn't last forever, oh

Tonight couldn't last forever
We are one choice from together
Family, we're family

Oh, tonight couldn't last forever
We are one choice from together
You and me
Yeah, you and me

Tonight's the night
For the sinners and the saints
Two worlds collide in a glorious display
'Cause it's all love tonight when we step across the line

We can sail across the sea to a city with one king
A city on our knees, a city on our knees, oh
A city on our knees, a city on our knees, oh

If we gotta start somewhere, why not here?
If we gotta start sometime, why not now?
