I've been here before, now here I am again
Standing at the door, praying You'll let me back in
To label me a prodigal would be
Only scratching the surface of who I've been known to be

Turn me around, pick me up, undo what I've become
Bring me back to the place of forgiveness and grace
I need You, I need Your help, I can't do this myself
You're the only one who can undo what I've become

I focused on the score but I can never win
Trying to ignore a life of hiding my sin
To label me a hypocrite would be
Only scratching the surface of who I've been known to be, yeah

Turn me around, pick me up, undo what I've become
Bring me back to the place of forgiveness and grace
I need You, I need Your help, I can't do this myself
You're the only one who can undo what I've become

Make every step lead me back
To the sovereign way that You

Turn me around, pick me up, undo what I've become
Bring me back to the place of forgiveness and grace
I need You, I need Your help, I can't do this myself
You're the only one who can undo

You are the only one who can undo
You are the only one who can undo what I've become
You're the only one
