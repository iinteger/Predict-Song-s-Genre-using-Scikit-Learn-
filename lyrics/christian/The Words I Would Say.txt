Three in the morning and I'm still awake
So I picked up a pen and a page
And I started writing just what I'd say
If we were face to face

I'd tell you just what you mean to me
Tell you these simple truths

Be strong in the Lord and never give up hope
You're gonna do great things
I already know God's got His hand on you

So don't live life in fear, forgive and forget
But don't forget why you're here
Take your time and pray
These are the words I would say

Last time we spoke you said you were hurting
And I felt your pain in my heart
I want to tell you that I keep on praying
That love will find you where you are

I know 'cause I've already been there
So please, hear these simple truths

Be strong in the Lord and never give up hope
You're gonna do great things
I already know God's got His hand on You

So don't live life in fear, forgive and forget
But don't forget why you're here
Take your time and pray
These are the words I would say

Say from one simple life to another
I will say come find peace in the Father

Be strong in the Lord and never give up hope
You're gonna do great things
I already know God's got His hand on You

So don't live life in fear, forgive and forget
But don't forget why you're here

Take your time and pray
And thank God for each day
His love will find a way
These are the words I would say
