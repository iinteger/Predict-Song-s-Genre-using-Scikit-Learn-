Savior I come*

Redemptions hill
Where Your blood was spilled
For my ransom, yeah, yeah
Oh, everything I once held dear
I count it all as lost

And lead me to the cross
Where Your love poured out
And Bring me to my knees

Tempted and trialed

The word became flesh
Bore my sin and death (bore my sin and death)
