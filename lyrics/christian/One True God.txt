I don't have a God I can put on a stand
Or a God I hold in the palm of my hand
I have a God that's holding me

And I don't have a God that I can create
In the place I live with the money I make
I have a God, He made everything

So I don't need a temporary man-made deity
When I got the real thing, I got the real thing

He's the Lord of all the earth, the maker of all things
He alone is the one true God
Kingdoms rise and fall but even through it all
He remains the one true God

I don't have a thing that I got on my own
I don't have a care that I carry alone
But I have a God who's carrying me

And I don't have sin that He doesn't forgive
And I don't have a heart that is worthy of His
But I have a God who still loves me

So I don't need a temporary man-made deity
When I got the real thing, I got the real thing

Lord of all the earth, the maker of all things
He alone is the one true God
Kingdoms rise and fall but even through it all
He remains the one true God

Who is this King of Glory? The Lord strong and mighty
Who is this King of Glory? The Lord strong and mighty
Who is this King of Glory? Who is this King of Glory?

He's the Lord of all the earth, the maker of all things
He alone is the one true God
Kingdoms rise and fall but even through it all
He remains the one true God

He's the Lord of all the earth, the maker of all things
He alone is the one true God
Kingdoms rise and fall but even through it all
He remains the one true God
He is, He is the one true God

I don't have a God I can put on a stand
And I don't have a God I can hold in my hand
But I have a God holding me
