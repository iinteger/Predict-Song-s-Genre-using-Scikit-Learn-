Sometimes my life just don't make sense at all
When the mountains look so big
And my faith just seems so small

So hold me, Jesus, 'cause I'm shaking like a leaf
You have been King of my glory
Won't You be my Prince of peace?

When I wake up in the night, I feel the dark
It's so hot inside my soul
I swear there must be blisters on my heart

So hold me, Jesus, 'cause I'm shaking like a leaf
You have been King of my glory
Won't You be my Prince of peace?

Surrender don't come natural to me
I'd rather fight You for something I don't really want
Than to take what You give that I need
And I've beat my head against so many walls
I'm falling down, I'm falling on my knees, God please

And the Salvation Army band is playing this hymn
And Your grace rings out so deep
It makes my resistance seem so thin

So hold me, Jesus, 'cause I'm shaking like a leaf
You have been King of my glory
Won't You be my Prince of peace?

So hold me, Jesus, 'cause I'm shaking like a leaf
You have been King of my glory
Won't You be my Prince of peace?
  (I surrender all)
Come and be my Prince of peace, oh Lord
  (I surrender all)

Hold me, Jesus, 'cause I'm shaking like a leaf
You have been King of my glory
Won't You be my Prince of peace?

And hold me, Jesus, 'cause I'm shaking like a leaf
You have been King of my glory
Won't You be my Prince of peace?

You have been King of my glory
Come and be my Prince of peace
Lord, You are the Prince of peace
Come and be my Prince of peace
