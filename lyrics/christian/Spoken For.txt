Take this world from me
I don't need it anymore
I am finally free
My heart is spoken for

Oh and I praise You
Oh and I worship You

Covered by Your love divine
Child of the risen Lord
To hear You say, "This one's mine"
My heart is spoken for

Now I have a peace
I've never known before
I find myself complete
My heart is spoken for

Oh and I praise You
Oh and I worship You

Covered by Your love divine
Child of the risen Lord
To hear You say, "This one's mine"
My heart is spoken for

By the power of the cross
You've taken what was lost
And made it fully Yours
And I have been redeemed
By You who spoke to me
Now I am spoken for

Covered by Your love divine
Child of the risen Lord
To hear You say, "This one's mine"
My heart is spoken for, yeah

Covered by Your love divine
Child of the risen Lord
To hear You say, "This one's mine"
My heart is spoken for

Take this world from me
I don't need it anymore
