I set out on a narrow way, many years ago
Hoping I would find true love, along the broken
road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign, pointed straight to
you

Every long lost dream lead me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like
northern stars
Pointing me on my way, into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That lead me straight to you

I think about the years I spent, just passing
through
I'd like to take the time I lost, and give it back to
you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there you understand
It's all part of the grander plan, that is coming true

Every long lost dream, lead me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like
northern stars
Pointing me on my way, into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That lead me straight to you

Now I'm just rolling home
Into my loving arms
This much I know, is true
That God blessed the broken road
That lead me straight to you
That God blessed the broken road
That lead me straight
to you
