Well, today I found myself
After searching all these years
And the man that I saw
He wasn't at all who I thought he'd be

I was lost when You found me here
And I was broken beyond repair
Then You came along
And You sang Your song over me

It feels like I'm born again
It feels like I'm living
For the very first time
For the very first time in my life

Make a promise to me now
Reassure my heart somehow
That the love that I feel
Is so much more real than anything

I've a feeling in my soul
And I pray that I'm not wrong
That the life I have now
Is only the beginning

It feels like I'm born again
It feel like I'm living
For the very first time
For the very first time

It feels like I'm breathing
  (It feels like I'm born again)
It feels like I'm moving
  (It feels like I'm living)
For the very first time
  (For the very first time)
For the very first time
  (For the very first time)

I wasn't looking for something that was more
Than what I had yesterday
Then You came to me and You gave to me
Life and a love that I never known, that I never felt before

It feels like I'm born again
  (Feels like I'm born again)
It feel like I'm living
  (It feel like I'm living)
For the very first time
  (For the very first time)
I'm living for the first time
  (For the very first time)

It feels like I'm breathing
  (It feels like I'm born again)
It feels like I'm moving
  (It feels like I'm living)
For the very first time
  (For the very first time)
I'm living for the first time
  (For the very first time)
In my life
