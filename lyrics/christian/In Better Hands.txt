It's hard to stand on shifting sand
It's hard to shine in the shadows of the night
You can't be free if you don't reach for help
And you can't love if you don't love yourself

But there is hope when my faith runs out
'Cause I'm in better hands now

It's like the sun is shining
When the rain is pouring down
It's like my soul is flying
Though my feet are on the ground

So take this heart of mine, there's no doubt
I'm in better hands now

I am strong, all because of You
I stand in awe of every mountain that You move
For I am changed, yesterday is gone
I am safe from this moment on

And there's no fear when the night comes 'round
I'm in better hands now

It's like the sun is shining
When the rain is pouring down
It's like my soul is flying
Though my feet are on the ground

So take this heart of mine, there's no doubt
I'm in better hands, yeah

It's like the sun is shining
When the rain is pouring down
It's like my soul is flying
Though my feet are on the ground

It's like the world is silent
Though I know it isn't true
It's like the breath of Jesus
Is right here in this room

So take this heart of mine, there's no doubt
I'm in better hands now
I'm in better hands now
