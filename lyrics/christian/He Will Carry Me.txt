He Will Carry Me
I call, You hear me
I've lost it all 
And it's more then I can bear
I feel so empty

Your strong, I'm weary
I'm holding on 
But I feel like giving in
But still You're with me

(Pre-chorus and Chorus)
And even though I'm walking 
Through the valley of the shadow
I will hold tight to the hand of Him
Who's love will comfort me
And when my hope is gone
And I've been wounded in the battle
He is all the strength that I will ever need
He will carry me

I know I'm broken
But You alone
Can mend this heart of mine
Your always with me

And even though I'm walking 
Through the valley of the shadow
I will hold tight to the hand of Him 
Who's love will comfort me
And when my hope is gone
And I've been wounded in the battle
He is all the strength that I will ever need
He will carry me
He will carry me

(Bridge)
And even though I feel so lonely
Like I have never been before
You never said it would be easy
But You said You'd see me through the storm

And even though I'm walking 
Through the valley of the shadow
I will hold tight to the hand of Him 
Who's love will comfort me
And when my hope is gone
And I've been wounded in the battle
He is all the strength that I will ever need
He will carry me 
He will carry me
He will carry me
