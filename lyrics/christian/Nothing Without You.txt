Take these hands and lift them up
For I have not the strength
To praise You near enough
For I have nothing
I have nothing without You

Take my voice and pour it out
And let it sing the songs of mercy
I have found
For I have nothing
I have nothing without You

And all my soul needs
Is all Your love to cover me
So all the world will see
That I have nothing without You

So take my body and build it up
May it be broken
As an offering of love
For I have nothing
I have nothing without You

And all my soul needs
Is all Your love to cover me
So all the world will see
That I have nothing
I love You

With all my heart
With all my soul
With all my mind
With all the strength that I can find

And all my soul needs
Is all Your love to cover me
So all the world can see
That I have nothing

Take my time here on this earth
And let it glorify all that You are worth
For I am nothing
I am nothing without You
