When God Made You
When God Made You(Duet with Natalie Grant)- Eddie Carswell,Michael O'Brien


It's always been a mystery to me
How two hearts can come together 
And love can last forever
But now that I have found you, I believe
That a miracle has come
When God send the perfect one
Now gone are all my questions about why
And I've never been so sure of anything in my life

Chorus: I wonder what God was thinking 
When He created you
I wonder if He knew everything I would need
Because He made all my dreams come true
When God made you 
He must have been thinking about me

I promise that wherever you may go
Wherever life may lead you 
With all my heart I'll be there too
From this monent on I want you to know
I'll let nothing come between us
And I will love the ones you love

Bridge: He made the sun  He made the moon 
To harmonize in perfect tune 
One can't move with out the other
They just have to be together
ANd that is why I know its true 
You're for me and I'm for you 
'Cause my would just Can't be right 
Without you in my life

Tag chorus

He must have heard every prayer i've been praying
Yes he knew everything i would need
when God made you 
when dreams come true
He must have been thinking about me
