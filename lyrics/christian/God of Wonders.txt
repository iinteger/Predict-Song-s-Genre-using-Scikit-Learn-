Lord of all creation
Lord of heaven and earth
Lord of all creation
Of water, earth and sky
The heavens are your Tabernacle
Glory to the Lord on high

God of wonders beyond our galaxy

When I stumble in the darkness
I will call your name by night

You are holy, holy
The universe declares your majesty
You are holy, holy
