He's My Son
I'm down on my knees again tonight 
I'm hoping this prayer will turnout right 
See there is a boy that needs your help 
I've done all that I can do myself 
His mother is tired 
I'm sure you can understand 
Each night as he sleeps 
She goes in to hold his hand 
And she tries not to cry 
As the tears fill her eyes 
Chorus:
Can you hear me? 
Am I getting through tonight? 
Can you see him? 
Can you make him feel all right? 
If you can hear me 
Let me take his place somehow 
See, he's not just anyone 
He's my son 

Sometimes late at night I watch him sleep 
I dream of the boy he'd like to be 
I try to be strong and see him through But God who he needs right now is You Let him grow old Live life without fear 
What would I be Living without him here 
He's so tired and he's scared 
Let him know that You're there 
repeat chorus 
Can you hear me? Can you see him? Please don't leave him He's my son.
