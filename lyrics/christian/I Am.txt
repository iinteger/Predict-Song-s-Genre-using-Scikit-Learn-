Who always was
And is to come
I am the one who walked on water
I am the one who calmed the seas
I am the miracles and wonders
So come and see
And follow me

Who bore the sins of man
The author and perfecter
Beginning and the end
I am

I am the spirit deep inside you
I am the word upon your heart
I am the one who even knew you
Before your birth
Before you were
