This is the start
This is your heart
This is the day you were born
This is the sun
These are your lungs
This is the day you were born

And I am always, always
Always yours
I am always, always
Always yours

These are the scars
Deep in your heart
This is the place you were born
This is the hole
Where most of your soul
Comes ripping out
From the places you've been torn

And it is always, always
Always yours
I am always, always
Always yours

Hallelujah!
I'm caving in
Hallelujah!
I'm in love again
Hallelujah!
I'm a wretched man
Hallelujah!
Every breath is a second chance
Yeah!

And it is always, always
Always yours
I am always, always
Always yours
Always, always
Always yours
Always, always
Always yours
Juro que amo todas tus carencias, aunque aprueben mi paciencia, amo todo si es contigo.
