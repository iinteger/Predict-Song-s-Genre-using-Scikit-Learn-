Even before there was a drop in the ocean
Even before there was a star in the sky
Even before the world was put in motion
You were on Your throne, You were on Your throne

You reign, glory in the highest, You reign
Let creation testify by Your name
Every knee will bow and every tongue proclaim
That Jesus reigns

Even before Your hand made the heavens
Even before the breath of all mankind
Even before we had to be forgiven
You were on Your throne, You were on Your throne

You reign, glory in the highest, You reign
Let creation testify by Your name
Every knee will bow and every tongue proclaim
That Jesus reigns

Yesterday, today and forever
You are God who was and is and is to come
You reign, glory in the highest, You reign

You reign, glory in the highest, You reign
Let creation testify by Your name
Every knee will bow and every tongue proclaim
Let every tongue proclaim, let every tongue proclaim
That Jesus reigns
