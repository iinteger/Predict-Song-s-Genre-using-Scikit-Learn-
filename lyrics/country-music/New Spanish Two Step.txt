Down below the Rio Grande, a senorita held my hand
And sweetly sang an old melody
Without a worry or a care
A rose she gave me from her hair
And then she whispered, "Si, Senor, Si"
In a cabaret we dance the hours away
Her eyes told more than words e'er could say
I told her I had to go, left her down in Mexico
While the band play Spanish Two Step soft and low
