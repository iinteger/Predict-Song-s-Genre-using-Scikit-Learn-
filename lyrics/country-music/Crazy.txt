Crazy
I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy
Crazy for feeling so blue

I knew you'd love me
As long as you wanted
And then someday
You'd leave me for somebody new

Worry
Why do I let myself worry?
Wonderin'
What in the world did I do?

Crazy for thinkin
That my love could hold you
I'm crazy for tryin' and crazy for cryin'
And I'm crazy for lovin' you

Crazy for thinking
That my love could hold you
I'm crazy for tryin' and crazy for cryin'
And I'm crazy for lovin' you
