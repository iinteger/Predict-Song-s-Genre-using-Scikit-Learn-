I'll Hold You In My Arms (1947)
I’ll hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms
Like you’ve never been held before
I’ll think of each day and then I’ll dream the night away
Till you are in my arms once more

The stars up in the sky know the reason why
I feel so blue when I’m away from you
I’ll hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms
So darling, please wait for me
